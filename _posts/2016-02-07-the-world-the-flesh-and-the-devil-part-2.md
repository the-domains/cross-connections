**Chapter 5- Dead to the
World**

****

****

**Far be it from me to boast
except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been
crucified to me, and I to the world. ~Galatians 6:14**

Worldliness is any
thinking, feeling, or doing in which God is absent---any pursuit that does not
have God as its North Star and central frame of reference. With that
devastatingly broad definition, how would you evaluate yourself? How did you do
in the weed-whacking evaluation at the end of chapter 2? Jesus diagnosed those
weeds of worldliness in Mark 4:

__

_They are the ones who hear the word, but the cares of the world
and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and
choke the word, and it proves unfruitful._

That phrase "cares of the
world" is particularly freighted with meaning that points to the absence of God
as the central characteristic of worldliness. It comes from the Greek word
"merimna," which means care, worry, or anxiety. That seems simple enough; these
are the weeds of worry that choke the gospel word and make it unfruitful. But
it actually goes deeper than that. The root of this Greek word "merimna" has
the idea of being pulled in two different directions at the same time; it's
often translated as "distraction." The particular type of worry that Jesus has
in mind is the kind of worry that distracts from kingdom building and fruit
producing. It's a worry that is overly drawn to concerns and agendas, pulling
you away from higher concerns and agendas. Jesus gently cautioned against this
kind of worldly anxiety which distracts from kingdom causes in Matthew 6, when
he said, 

__

_Do not be anxious, saying "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we
drink?" or "What shall we wear?" For the Gentiles seek after all these things,
and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the
kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to
you._

It is not worldly to want
something to eat, drink, or wear. Your Father knows you need all those things
and delights to provide them for you out of the riches of his kindness to you
in Christ. What 

_is_

worldly is for those material needs and desires to
distract you from what is of first importance. Note that Jesus doesn't say
"Don't seek those things." He says, "Don't seek them 

_first_

. Seek 

_first
_

God's kingdom and righteousness." When God and his purposes are your
highest priority---your North Star and central frame of reference---then every
other concern finds its place in relation to him. 

A good way to visualize
this is to picture the solar system. When Jesus Christ is the sun at the center
of the solar system of your life---his gravity and glory holding everything else
in place---then every planet of desire and duty finds its proper orbit around
him. But worldliness is when he is removed from the center and replaced with
stuff, even good and necessary things. Just imagine if the earth suddenly
replaced the sun at the center of the solar system; without the sun's gravity
holding every planet in place, the entire solar system would spin into chaos.
In the same way, the things of this world are not weighty enough to hold the
center, and when they displace Jesus, everything else starts spinning out of
control. Worldliness is God displaced from the center, and every sorrow and sin
is the outworking of the chaos unleashed by that exchange. 

So the great and urgent
question before us is, How do we keep God at the center? With so many things
vying for our attention and affection, the fight against worldliness is a
never-ending struggle to keep my sinful heart from giving into the distractions
that pull me away from him.

I believe that the solution
to worldliness is not ultimately found in self-denial (saying "no" to worldly
things), although that certainly plays a part. Neither is it as simple as just
trying harder. No amount of mustered willpower can overcome the fatal
attraction that our hearts have to "the cares of the world, the deceitfulness
of riches, and the desire for other things." The only thing that can break the
allurement of the world is the allurement of something better. The only thing
that can overcome the "gravity" of worldliness is to behold a superior gravity,
superior glory, superior greatness.

BOASTING IN THE CROSS

In the book of Galatians,
Paul spends six chapters unpacking the gospel as the free gift of righteousness
and acceptance that comes to us through the costly sacrifice of God's Son. We
can't add to what he's done with our good works or religious duties; we can
only receive it by trusting his finished work. In this gospel is full and
glorious freedom---freedom from law and duty and worldliness and sin and death.
At the very end of his letter to the Galatians, Paul summarizes his whole
letter with one profound sentence that cuts to the very heart of worldliness,
and shows us the only path to victory against this enemy:

__

_Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by which the world was crucified to me, and I to the world. ~Galatians
6:14_

When he says, "Far be it
from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ," what he means
is this: My only glory, my highest joy, the center of my solar system, is the
cross of Jesus. His death on my behalf is the gravity that holds my life
together and the glory that outshines every other boast I could possibly make.

That's why he continues his
sentence. Think of all the things he could say about the cross of Jesus: "the
cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which all my sins were forgiven;" "the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which my eternal life was won;" "the cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ, by which the wrath of God was extinguished." Those are all
true, but are secondary to the point he wants to make, namely, that the cross
of Christ is the center of his life and his highest joy. And so he continues
his sentence by highlighting the most unexpected thing about the cross: it is
the instrument by which the world's power of allurement was decisively broken
in his life. "The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

_by which the world was
crucified to me, and I to the world._

"

When Paul says that the
cross is the instrument by which the world was crucified to him and he to the
world, he means that the distracting, alluring, pleasurable pull of the world
was decisively severed; the weeds of worldliness have been pulled up by their
roots. Think of this in terms of Jesus' parable in Mark 4: the "cares of the
world" no longer pull him away from God's purposes; the "deceitfulness of
riches" no longer tempt with their empty promises of happiness and security;
and the "desire for other things" has been replaced with a greater desire, a
yearning that he articulates in Philippians 3:

__

_Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing
Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and
count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ... ~Philippians 3:7-8_

How did this happen? Like
this: when Paul thought of the cross and considered the Prince of glory
suffering in the place of a guilty sinner like himself, he was so broken by the
great cost and moved by the great love that he exclaimed, "I will surrender
everything in pursuit of knowing this great Savior more! Whatever it costs,
knowing him is worth it! Compared to everything I used to love and pursue, he
is surpassing worth and gain!" Therein is the secret to victory over worldliness.
A heart that sees Christ like that is a heart freed from the allurement of
worldliness by the sight of superior glory.

This is how the human heart
works; we are, like moths to a flame, irresistibly drawn to the brightest
beauty we see. In every area of your life, even in the mundane things, you are
constantly desiring and pursuing what you perceive to be the best glory, until
that glory is displaced by something better. As a kid, I used to love Tootsie
rolls. I eagerly desired Tootsie rolls... until I discovered the superior glory
of Ghirardelli chocolate. Once I had tasted what gourmet chocolate tasted like,
the comparatively bland and plasticky taste of Tootsie rolls lost all their
power to tempt me. As a college student, I used to appreciate the utilitarian
value of any cheap cup of coffee; the lukewarm gas station swill was good
enough as long as it would keep me awake (I just had to add enough cream and
sugar). But then, on my honeymoon in Hawaii, my eyes were opened by a single
cup of expertly crafted cappuccino made with freshly roasted Kona coffee beans,
and I was immediately converted into a pretentious coffee snob. Now I scoff at
weak coffee and evangelize my friends as to the merits of quality espresso. But
how could I not boast in single-origin, fair-trade, handcrafted, seven dollar
lattes when they tasted so much 

_better_

than the gas station swill that
used to satisfy me?

Conversion---the supernatural
act by which the Holy Spirit makes you come alive to the beauty of Jesus so
that you embrace him as your Savior---is nothing more or less than a sight of
superior glory that makes what you used to live for taste like gas station
coffee by comparison. 2 Corinthians 4:4 says that before conversion, Satan's
main agenda in your life was to keep you from seeing Jesus as he really is.
"The god of this world \[Satan\] has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep
them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ." The reason
that Satan is so hell-bent on keeping people from 

_seeing_

is simple: if
your soul could catch a real glimpse of him, every chain that the world, the
flesh, and the devil could put on you would not be able to stand in the way of
you pursuing more of him. That's how God has designed the human heart to
operate: we are always irresistibly drawn to what we have experienced as best
until allured by something better. Not even Satan can override that fundamental
rule of human nature, and so the best he can do is to try everything in his
power to keep you from seeing in the first place.

Once the blinders have been
removed by the omnipotent power of God himself (2 Corinthians 4:6), the whole
rest of the Christian life and every step forward in sanctification is nothing
more or less than the same thing that saved you: striving for a sight of
superior glory. To see Jesus as more desirable than whatever else is tempting
me, to be more enamored with his love than I am with the latest gadget, to long
to experience and see him more deeply whatever the cost, is the beating heart
of the Christian life and the foundation for freedom from worldliness. In 2
Corinthians 3:18 we are given a simple yet profound recipe for spiritual
transformation: "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the
Lord, are being transformed into the same image, from one degree of glory to
another. For this comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit." Beholding is
becoming; the glory that draws our attention is what we will pursue and become
more like. 

And where is the place that
the glory and grace of Jesus shines the brightest? The answer is, the cross. At
the cross we see his tender love, stooping servanthood, bleeding humility,
flaming holiness, and peerless worth most clearly. So the strategy for freedom
from worldliness is clear: make war on the worldliness in your heart by 

_surveying
the wondrous cross_

. 

SURVEYING A SUPERIOR GLORY

In 1707, Isaac Watts wrote
one of the most famous hymns of the English language, "When I Survey the
Wondrous Cross." He based the hymn on Galatians 6:14, the key text to disarming
worldliness. In this hymn, Isaac Watts points us to the ultimate defeat of
worldliness in the believing heart: surveying the wondrous cross, from which a
glory so superior shines, that every worldly gain is seen as loss and every
charming object is seen as vain and empty by comparison. There are five verses
to this song, and each one builds on the preceding verse, laying a gospel
foundation for freedom from worldliness.

When I survey the wondrous cross

On which the Prince of glory died,

My richest gain I count but loss,

And pour contempt on all my pride.

The first verse of the hymn
lays out the central thesis of the song, and the motivating power behind all of
the Christian life: "When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of
glory died, my richest gain I count but loss, and pour contempt on all my
pride." Nothing but surveying "the wondrous cross" in all its multifaceted
glory could be enough to make every gain look like loss by comparison. The
exceeding value of the Prince of glory only highlights the enormity of the
cross and the preciousness of his sacrifice: he is doing it for me! Every
treasure we hold dear can not hold a candle to the great worth of this Prince
of glory, who loved me and gave himself for me. How could we not press in with
all our hearts to know this great Savior better?

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast

Save in the death of Christ my God!

All the vain things that charm me most,

I sacrifice them to His blood.

The second verse is the
response to surveying the wondrous cross: "Forbid it, Lord, that I should
boast, except in the death of Christ my God!" Let my only joy, my only boast,
my only glory, be in this truth: that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, laid down
his life for me. Jeremiah 9:23-24 puts it this way: "Let not the wise man boast
in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man
boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands
and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice, and
righteousness in the earth." Let our boasts be, "I know the God whose steadfast
love paid the price of his justice in order to clothe me with his perfect
righteousness!" 

In response to this
unfathomable, glorious love comes the second part of my response: "All the vain
things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood." This isn't a
sacrifice that is trying to earn something more from God; it's my meager
offering made in response to his perfect, final offering. This is the act of
dethroning the "desire for other things" from the throne of my heart and
reinstalling Jesus as my rightful King and Center. This is the act of laying
down every one of my desires, all my dreams, and every possession and
longing---even good ones---at the foot of the cross and seeing them as what they
really are: vain, empty things that "charm" me but can never satisfy. In
exchange for these empty treasures, I find at the cross enough glory to fully
satisfy my soul forever.

See from His head, His hands, His feet,

Sorrow and love flow mingled down!

Did ever such love and sorrow meet,

Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

The third verse is the
heart of the song, slowing down long enough for us to learn what, exactly, it
means to "survey the wondrous cross." It means to linger long enough to let the
sight affect you, move you, break you, and bring you to your knees. See from
the Savior's head, infinitely precious blood flowing from the mocking crown of
thorns---and see your own mockery and cynicism in the thorns that pierced him.
See the Savior's hands pierced through by more than nails; look again and see
the weight of sin and resolve of love that held him there when he could have
summoned legions of angels to his rescue if he had wished. Marvel that the
hands that formed worlds and stars and hold together the universe (Colossians
1:17) still bear the scars of your rebellion and his rescue. And wonder that
your own guilty name is written in those wounds with indelible, pardoning
blood; hear the Savior say to you, "I will not forget you; behold, I have
engraved you on the palms of my hands" (Isaiah 49:15-16). Ponder the sorrow of
sin, Jesus' bitter weeping in the garden as he contemplated drinking the cup of
wrath (Isaiah 51:17), the Savior's anguished grief when the Father turned his
face away... and consider that this grief was yours, not his, and yet he freely
bore it so that all of your tears might be wiped away forever. "He has borne
our griefs and carried our sorrows." This is the richest of all crowns, more
precious than gold, the highest possible praise to heap on King Jesus: he bled
and wept and died for me. 

His dying crimson, like a robe,

Spreads o'er His body on the tree;

Then I am dead to all the globe

And all the globe is dead to me

The fourth verse is the
proper response to seeing the great love and sorrow of the Savior, the death of
worldliness in the death of Jesus. As I see my sin executed in the person of my
substitute, the punishment I deserve falling on him, "his dying crimson" blood
buying my costly pardon, the clear sight of such love and sorrow, I realize
that this is the highest, best glory that there is to see. Nothing could be
sweeter, nothing could be deeper, nothing could be brighter, than the sweetness
and depth and brightness of this amazing grace. This is the taste of joy that
ruins me for every other lesser sweetness, the depth of mercy that exposes
every other shallow thrill for what it really is, the brilliance of glory that
outshines every other feeble worldly candle. That's what it means to be
crucified to the world; it is dead to me, and I am unresponsive to its
allurements, caught up in a greater thrill than it could possibly offer. "Then
you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and exult" (Isaiah 60:5).

Were the whole realm of nature mine,

That would be an offering far too small;

Love so amazing, so divine,

Demands my soul, my life, my all!

The hymn ends with the
reoriented worldview of the ransomed, ravished heart: everything in the world,
every trinket, toy, and treasure, exists to be an offering of love to the One
who first offered himself in love for me. Those two lines, "Were the whole
realm of nature mine, that would be an offering far too small!" captures the
change of heart when Jesus replaces worldly treasures as the center of the
solar system. Instead of the world being a temptation to idolatry and a
distraction from kingdom pursuits, it is placed back into its proper orbit and
becomes what it was created to be: a springboard to worship. Every material
blessing I have is a gift of his grace, to be received with thankfulness and
used in his service. Every gift and ability I have exists not for my praise but
his. How could it be any other way, when he has done so much for me? Such
amazing love demands, deserves, and daily lays claim on my soul, my life, my
all. To the heart that has tasted the goodness of knowing a crucified Savior,
such a demand is not duty but the highest possible delight: living in pursuit
of him who died for me. Could there be any greater joy?

__

_Oh Lord, I confess that my heart is all too often cold toward you.
Even when I sing songs like, "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross," I don't feel
the wonder, I don't sense the joy, that I know I should. Forgive my stubborn
heart, and bend me to your Word. Open my eyes and fill me with your Spirit as I
behold Jesus in the gospel, until I am moved by what I see._

**Chapter 6- The Crucified
Flesh**

****

**We know that our old self
was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to
nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. ~Romans 6:6**

There's a strange phrase
that appears over and over again in the New Testament. It's so ubiquitous that
you might have never really noticed it, let alone spent time dwelling on its
significance and power. It's the phrase "in Christ." That specific phrase
appears 83 times in the writings of Paul, and when you include its equivalents
like "in him" or "in the Lord," it's there a whopping 216 times! It's on every
page of Paul's writings, over and over and over again. Consider these few
examples, all taken from the short letter of Ephesians:

Blessed be the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us 

_in Christ_

with every
spiritual blessing in the heavenly places. ~Ephesians 1:3

He chose us 

_in him_

before the foundation of the world. ~Ephesians 1:4

__

_In him_

we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our
trespasses. ~Ephesians 1:5

__

_In him_

we have obtained an inheritance. ~Ephesians 1:11

He raised us up 

_with him_

and seated us 

_with him_

in the heavenly places 

_in Christ Jesus_

, so
that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in
kindness towards us 

_in Christ Jesus_

. ~Ephesians 2:6-7

We are his workmanship,
created 

_in Christ Jesus_

for good works. ~Ephesians 2:10

But now 

_in Christ Jesus_

you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
~Ephesians 2:13

__

_In him_

you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God
by the Spirit. ~Ephesians 2:22

Be kind to one another,
tenderhearted, forgiving one another as God 

_in Christ_

forgave you.
~Ephesians 4:32

It's everywhere! This is
one of the most pervasive themes of the New Testament. In the opening paragraph
of Ephesians alone, Paul says that we are blessed in Christ, chosen in Christ,
redeemed in Christ, given an inheritance in Christ, and sealed by the Holy
Spirit in Christ. In the rest of the letter, he talks about how we were raised
with Christ, seated in Christ, recreated in Christ, brought near in Christ,
built into a dwelling place for God in Christ, forgiven in Christ, and more.
Every aspect of the Christian life can only be understood in relation to this
massive, mysterious truth: we are 

_in Christ_

.

And yet, what exactly does
that mean? If you're anything like me, you probably just skim over those words
when you read them, not giving them much thought. When I read 2 Corinthians
5:17---"If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation"---I usually just skip to the
second part and think about what it means to be a new creation, instead of
considering the foundational condition in the first part: "if anyone is in
Christ." The only way to be a new creation is to be in Christ. But what does
that mean?

UNION WITH OUR
REPRESENTATIVE

Remember back in chapter 3,
when uncovering the origins of the flesh, we looked at Romans 5:12-21 to see a
surprising truth? We are not, most fundamentally, individuals, but have been
created by God to be united to one representative. God created the human race
to be---in some mysterious yet very real way---united together and represented
before him by one man. That original representative was Adam, and Romans 5
explains that because Adam represented everyone united to him (all humanity),
his actions counted for them. By virtue of your humanity, you come into this
world united to your representative, Adam. God credits the actions of your
representative, and the consequences of those actions, to you. When Adam ate
the fruit, you ate the fruit 

_in him_

. When Adam received the sentence of
spiritual death, you received the the sentence of spiritual death 

_in him_

.
The power of sin and the allurement of the world usurped God from the throne of
Adam's heart, and therefore usurped the throne of your heart 

_in him_

.
That's why 1 Corinthians 15:22 says simply, "In Adam all die."

The incredible good news
that we saw back in chapter 3, however, is that God in his great wisdom so
constituted the human race so that the very thing that was our downfall was
turned around to be the means of our rescue. Jesus became a man in order to be
the new representative for a new human race: all who would be united to him by
faith. And in the same way that Adam's disobedience was credited to you---even
though you didn't do it---and you reaped both the eternal consequence of that sin
and its daily power in your life; so also Jesus' perfect obedience was credited
to you---even though you didn't do it---and now you reap both the eternal
consequences of that obedience and its daily power in your life. When Jesus
resisted and overcame Satan's temptations in the wilderness, you resisted and
overcame Satan's temptations 

_in him_

. When Jesus perfectly honored his
Father and obeyed him completely, you perfectly honored the Father 

_in him_

.
That's why the Bible speaks of being justified---declared righteous---

_in Christ;
_

because he is your representative, his obedience counts as your obedience.
And when Jesus paid the penalty of death for sin, you paid the penalty of death

_in him_

. That's why the Bible speaks of being forgiven and reconciled and
redeemed 

_in Christ; _

because he is your representative, his payment
counts as your payment. When he paid sin's penalty perfectly, once for all, God
marked your account as "paid in full."

You can see, then, that the
doctrine of union with Christ is not just theoretical or theological. This
isn't an ivory tower, esoteric discussion; this is the heart of the gospel.
This is the only basis of your acceptance before God: everything Jesus did
counts for you. Think for a moment of the practical implications of that truth,
if you really start to see it in Scripture and believe it.

When you stumble into that
same pattern of sin for the ten thousandth time, you are secure in the love and
favor of your Father because 

_Jesus never stumbled_

. The Father considers
Jesus' obedience as counting for you. And he will not hold you accountable for
your failure, because he considers it already paid for, because Jesus' payment
counts for you. That means you can boldly approach the throne of grace with
confidence to ask for mercy and help (Hebrews 4:16). You don't have to hesitate
and cower like the prodigal son; you don't have to run away and hide from him
like Adam and Eve. You are accepted and beloved and righteous every moment of
every day, because Jesus never sinned, and in him, you're just as righteous as
he is.

And conversely, on your
best days---the days when you've had an hour-long quiet time and prayed for every
family member and nation of the wold and shared the gospel with three people
and said kind, humble things all day long---you have not added one brick to the
foundation of your acceptance before God. You are still accepted only on the
basis of Jesus' perfect obedience counting for you. And that's good news,
because your best prayers were shot through with doubts, and all your kind,
humble deeds were polluted with mixed motives, and you still sinned a thousand
times in thought and action. Your obedience doesn't make you any more secure
than your disobedience makes you insecure. Your security, your foundation, is
Jesus Christ and him alone. He is your righteousness, he is your payment for
sin, and every moment of every day you can confidently say, "I am forgiven and
accepted and beloved and righteous 

_in him_

."

We must get this---really 

_get
_

this, deep down in our hearts---if we are to live in the confidence and
freedom that the gospel offers us. Fight to see this in the Word, pray for
faith to truly believe it, and start venturing more and more of your hope onto
the solid rock and firm foundation of your representative's perfect obedience. 

There's an important reason
why I'm lingering on this doctrine, here in this chapter on the gospel and the
flesh. It's because, after uncovering the origins of the flesh in Romans 5,
this is exactly where Paul goes in Romans 6\. We're about to see that the war on
the sinful flesh can only be waged from this platform: everything Jesus did
counts for me. 

CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST

By the time that Paul has
finished up with Romans 5, he has so highly exalted grace and made such a big
deal of our acceptance before God apart from anything we do, that the question
naturally arises, "Well then, does it matter at all what we do? If God forgives
sin, should we go and throw a big sin party?" Paul's answer to that question is
a resounding no, but he goes about answering it by extending his argument about
our union with Christ: because Jesus' perfect obedience was credited to you,
you don't just reap the eternal consequences of his obedience, you also reap
its sin-conquering power in your daily life. Because everything Jesus did
counts for you, his death to sin was your death to sin, and his resurrection to
new life was your resurrection to new life.

__

_What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace
may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you
not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized
into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in
order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
we too might walk in newness of life. ~Romans 6:1-4_

Paul's argument here
extends our union with Christ and makes it the foundation not just of our
justification, but our sanctification as well. He says that our old self was
crucified with Jesus, not just so that we wouldn't bear its condemnation
anymore, but also in order that the power and presence of sin might be
decisively defeated, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. We can say
truly that Jesus died for us on the cross, but Paul wants us to see something
else, even more mysterious and wonderful. The good news of the gospel isn't
just that Jesus died for you on the cross; it's that when Jesus died, 

_you _

died
too. You were there on the cross too, because Jesus is your representative.
"Our old self was crucified with him." That's why God can look at you and
reckon your sins forgiven: the punishment for sin is death, and on the cross,
you died. That's why Paul stresses that you were baptized---joined---into Jesus'
death; that's another way of saying, "You have been included in his death in
such a way that when it happened to him, it happened to you." The punishment
has already been handed down; the payment has already been made in full.

This is the reality that
Paul talks about in Galatians 2:20- "I have been crucified with Christ. It is
no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in
the body I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for
me." I was executed on the cross, Paul says, and my life now is a life of union
by faith with the Savior who loved me and gave himself for me. In Colossians
3:3, Paul says it this way: "You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ
in God." My old self is no longer my identity; my identity is now wrapped up in
Jesus.

What, exactly, does it mean
that "our old self" died with Jesus on the cross? Obviously, in one sense you
weren't actually there---you weren't born yet. And yet that's not an obstacle for
a God who "inhabits eternity" (Isaiah 57:15) and invented time. If it can be
truly said that we sinned in Adam, it is just as easy to say that we died to
sin in Christ. 2 Timothy 1:9 says that God gave us his grace "in Christ Jesus
before the ages began." From eternity past, God planned to include you in
Jesus' death, and to execute your punishment there. And so, on that dark day in
33 AD, God took your old self---the human nature that was united with Adam and
credited with the damning consequences and enslaving power of his sin---and
nailed it to the cross there. The punishment that you were owed because of
Adam's sin was paid in full. 

But the reality of our
union with Christ is even bigger than that, and the truth that our old self was
nailed to the cross with Jesus has massive implications for our struggle with
the flesh today. Verse 2 puts it like this: "How can we who died to sin still
live in it?" We have been joined to Jesus (that's the reality which baptism
pictures) in such a way that his power of over sin and death has become 

_our_

power over sin and death: "Just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory
of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life." That newness of life is
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who has given you a new, tender heart that
is responsive to God and has the power to say "no" to sin and "yes" to God." By
virtue of Jesus' resurrection power over sin, you now have the ability, in him,
to say "no" to the sinful desires of your flesh, and "yes" to everything that
God is for you in Jesus.

ALREADY... NOT YET

But this is where it gets
tricky: to what extent is that newness of life ours 

_now_

? Paul says that
"our old self was crucified with him... so that we might no longer be enslaved to
sin." I don't know about you, but I still often 

_feel _

enslaved to sin. If
I have power to say "no" to sin, why do I still find myself saying "yes" so
often? I sympathize with what Paul says in the next chapter, Romans 7: "I don't
understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing
I hate... For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I
keep on doing." Why? If my old self was crucified with Christ, doesn't that
mean it's dead and gone? Why do I still feel like it's alive and kicking? Did
my old self somehow survive the crucifixion?

That's where Paul goes next
in his application of this doctrine of union with Christ. After saying that our
union with Jesus enables us to walk in newness of life, he continues in verse 5
with an important clarification: the fullness of this redemption comes in
stages.

__

_...We too might walk in newness of life. For (because) if we have
been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him
in a resurrection like his._

Paul is making a profound
argument here. We have the ability to walk in newness of life now 

_because_

,
just like we were united with Jesus' death, we shall certainly one day be
united with him in his resurrection. One has already happened; one hasn't taken
place yet. You can see that in the verb tenses of verse 5: "We 

_have been_

united with him in a death like his... we 

_shall_

certainly be united with
him in a resurrection like his." One has already happened; the other has not
yet fully materialized. And right now we are stuck in the middle between the
already and the not yet. But the power to live free now flows from the
certainty of that future event.

The whole Christian life is
lived in this tension between the already and the not yet. On one hand, we have
already been declared righteous; but we are not yet perfected and fully
conformed to that judgment (Hebrews 10:14). We are already children of God; but
we are not yet reigning with Christ in the full enjoyment of that title (1 John
3:2). We have already been given an inheritance; but we have not yet taken
possession of it (Ephesians 1:14). And while we have already been crucified
with Christ, we have not yet experienced the fullness of resurrection life like
Jesus has (1 Corinthians 15:52). We have a taste of it now, as Romans 6:4
affirms---we walk in newness of life, indwelt by the Holy Spirit---but full freedom
from death and sin is not quite ours yet.

CONSIDER YOURSELVES DEAD

But what does that mean for
us now, today? I think Paul's answer to that can be summarized like this: our
"already-happened" death with Christ decisively broke sin's power, and the way
we appropriate that power in our lives today is by banking on the certainty of
our "not-yet" resurrection with him. Your experience of "newness of life" and
power to say "no" to sinful desires rises and falls in proportion to your firm
anticipation of your future resurrection. Let's look at the next couple verses:

__

_We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the
body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved
to sin. For the one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have
died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that
Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has
dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the
life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin
and alive to God in Christ Jesus._

"The one who has
died"---that's you, by virtue of your union with Jesus---"has been set free from
sin." But in the next sentence, there's the already/not yet tension again: "If
we 

_have_

died with Christ, we believe that we 

_will _

also live with
him." We've died and have been set free from sin, but aren't yet alive in the
same way that Jesus currently is. We're still lugging around what Romans 7
calls "this body of death." Sin's power has been broken, but its still clinging
to us, wrapped up in our bodies down to the level of our DNA. The antidote has
been administered, but the poison is still circulating in our veins. Our sinful
nature has been nailed to the cross, but it's still kicking and whispering and
cajoling us to join in its suicidal desires.

But in the middle of this
already/not yet tension, Paul injects a note of hopeful certainty on which your
entire life hangs: Jesus is currently living in the fullness of his
resurrection life, and soon you will too. Verses 9-10: "We know that Christ,
being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion
over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he
lives he lives to God." We can have absolute confidence that Jesus'
resurrection did not fail; death has no dominion over him, and he is removed
from all effects of sin and enjoying the presence of his Father forever. And
that's the guarantee we have that one day our fight with sin will be over: "we
believe that we will also live with him." Jesus won the battle in his
resurrection, and because we were united with him in his death, one day we will
share that victory too. 

Look at the emphasis Paul
puts on our faith and certainty. "If we have died with Christ, we 

_believe _

that
we will also live with him. We 

_know _

that Christ, being raised from the
dead, will never die again." This hopeful certainty is the present-day power of
our future resurrection. The poison of sin is still circulating in your veins,
but to the extent you anticipate the antidote's power, the antidote begins
working now. Your hopeful certainty 

_is_

the antidote's present power.

We can see that in the way
Paul describes Jesus' resurrection life now, and what that has to do with our
flesh. Paul describes Jesus' resurrection life in verse 10: "the death he died
he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God." Note that
Paul didn't say that Jesus died "for sin" (although that's certainly true). He
said that Jesus died "to sin." When Paul says that Jesus "died to sin," he
means that all of sin's effects are gone from Jesus forever. He is no longer
subject to any temptation, and will never experience any of the consequences of
sin again. Of course, he never experienced consequences of 

_his_

sin,
because he didn't have any---but he did experience the consequences of 

_your_

sin, and he was tempted in every way that you are. But now he has died to sin;
on the cross, he took all of it on himself, brought it down to the grave, and
left it there. And now that he is in heaven in the presence of his Father, "the
life he lives, he lives to God." That means he is fully focused on and
committed to his Father's glory and purposes above all else. All his life and
power today is bent on completing his Father's agenda. 

That's what Jesus' life in
heaven is like now. And---here's the crucial connection---one day, that's what your
life will be like too. That's the connection that Paul made in verse 5: "If we
have been united with him in a death like his, we shall 

_certainly_

be
united with him in a resurrection like his." One day, all the effects and
temptations and consequences of sin will be removed from you permanently, and
you will finally be free to fully focus on the Father's glory and purposes
forever. That's what heaven is for the believer: final release from every trace
of remaining sin and freedom to joyfully pursue God unhindered forever. You are
nearer to that reality today than you were yesterday; every day moves you
closer to the finish line. Philippians 3:20-21 highlights this guarantee in
both its "already" and "not yet" dimensions: "Our citizenship is in heaven, and
from it we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform
our lowly body to be like his glorious body." Today, by virtue of our union
with Jesus' death and resurrection, our slavery to sin is broken and our
citizenship is now in heaven, and we look forward with eager anticipation to
finally participating in the fullness of Jesus' resurrection life. And it is in
that eager anticipation that we find victory over the flesh in the meantime.

That's why the way Paul
makes his conclusion in verse 11 is so important: 

__

_He died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to
God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in
Christ Jesus_

. 

That resurrection is your
certain future, so day by day live in the good of that future victory. He died
to sin and is free from all its tangling effects; so you reckon yourself
similarly dead to its effects. He is alive to God and fully focused on his
Father's purposes; so you likewise fix your mind on things that are above and
focus on the Father's purposes.

God has said that these
things are already true of you---in Ephesians and Colossians he says that "you 

_have_

been raised up with Christ"---and even though you aren't standing there yet, the
secret to victory over the flesh is to live like that's true. This doesn't mean
that the Christian life is some kind of mind game, an easy "believe it and it's
true" scheme. No, it's a lot harder than that; it's the call to trust what God
says more than you trust what you feel, because what he says is more real than
your feelings. The resurrection life of Jesus is yours now and will be yours
fully soon, so today, live like it. When your flesh whispers for you to give
into a temptation, say to your soul, "No, that desire is crucified with Christ
and no longer has any claim on me. I am alive to God and, by his grace, fixed
on his purposes. I don't have to obey that desire anymore; I have better things
to live for."

SET YOUR MIND ON THINGS
ABOVE

That's the complicated yet
life-changing argument of Romans 6\. If Paul's words have left your head
spinning, don't worry: I feel that way too. Living today with a radically
future-oriented faith is a difficult thing to understand, let alone accomplish.
So I want to end this chapter in Colossians 3, where this same flow of argument
is condensed and practically applied:

__

_If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are
above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on
things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and
your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears,
then you also will appear with him in glory. Put to death, therefore, what is
earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and
covetousness, which is idolatry. ~Colossians 3:1-5_

Do you see how the same
flow of logic from Romans 6 is working here in Colossians 3? You are united to
Jesus' death and resurrection; therefore set your mind and attention and
pursuit on heavenly things, where Christ is reigning in the fullness of his
resurrection life. Do this, verse 3 says, 

_because_

you have died with
Christ, and your life is now wrapped up with him. Wait with eager anticipation
for your own resurrection life to appear (verse 4), and in the meantime, in
light of that coming glory, put to death all those earthly desires of your
flesh. Put to death what has already been executed at the cross of Christ.
Those earthly desires were crucified with Christ; so instead of listening to
them cajoling you from the cross, take the sword of the Spirit---the promises of
God---and run them through with its blade, and do not let them distract you from
"seeking the things that are above" where your resurrection life is waiting for
you.

In chapter 9 we will
further unpack what this means practically; how, in the words of Romans 8:13,
to "by the Spirit put to death the deeds of the flesh."

__

_Holy Spirit, Increase my faith and help
me to set my mind on things above. Help me to truly look forward to my ultimate
union with Jesus, to long for my inheritance, to eagerly anticipate my full
citizenship in heaven. And then help me, in the power of that anticipation, to
put to death everything earthly that remains in me. _

**Chapter 7- The Devil
Disarmed**

****

**He disarmed the rulers and
authorities and put them to open shame, triumphing over them in him.
~Colossians 2:15**

Think back to chapter 3 and
consider the frightening range of murderous agendas that Satan pursues against
God's people, coupled with his vast (although leashed) supernatural power. He
is far smarter than you, immensely more powerful than you, knows the Bible
better than you, and is hellbent on your everlasting destruction. Barring that,
he'd settle for just ruining your life. He hates God and those made in the
image of God. That means he doubly hates you: not only are you created in God's
image, but you're being remade into the image of Jesus, are prized by God
himself, and are being wooed away from his temptations by a glory that he can't
match. You make him sick with rage (Revelation 12:11-12).

Of all the things that
Satan can do and all the power he wields, what do you think is the most deadly?
What's his greatest weapon? If you think it's his power to possess people,
you've watched too many horror movies. Yes, Satan and his demonic hosts have
the power to possess and control unbelievers, but they have far more subtle and
deadly tools at their disposal than the plot of "The Exorcist." Besides, a
cursory reading of the gospels shows that Jesus utterly shatters this power,
and has granted the same authority to his people (Luke 10:17-20). You don't
have to fear his power of possession.

Neither is Satan's worst
weapon his ability to cause sickness or distress. He afflicts and oppresses and
prowls around like a roaring lion, but Jesus' word of promise stands firm: "All
things---even all of Satan's agendas and devices---work together for good for those
who love God and are called according to his purposes." Seriously, Satan must
have the most frustrating job in the universe, seeing every one of his trials
turned around to good over and over again by the sovereign hand of God. If I
were him, I would have given up in disgust long ago. 

Even one of Satan's most
devastating abilities---his power to "blind the minds of unbelievers to keep them
from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ" (2 Corinthians 4:4)
is no match for the sovereign, unblinding work of the Holy Spirit that
accompanies the proclamation of the gospel. Just two verses after describing
Satan's blinding power, Paul unveiled the antidote: "God, who said, 'Let light
shine out of darkness,' has shone in our hearts to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." When God speaks
with this authority to the human heart, all of Satan's blinders are shattered,
and that heart sees the glory of Jesus in the gospel and is irresistibly drawn
to embrace him as Savior. This is happening a thousand times a day, all over
the world, as God's kingdom expands and sinners come to the Savior. A thousand
times a day, God's sovereign brightness pierces Satan's blindness. He doesn't
always do this of course---salvation belongs to him alone and he has his own
purposes and plans---but one of my greatest joys in ministry is seeing Satan
routed in this way over and over again. It's a beautiful thing.

THE DEVIL'S ONLY DEADLY
WEAPON

No, these aren't Satan's
worst weapons. For all of Satan's prowling around like a roaring lion, for all
of his slavery and oppression and temptations, Satan actually only has one
weapon with which he can fully and finally destroy your life and drag you down
to hell with him. That weapon is 

_unforgiven sin_

. 

"Really?" you might say.
"How is my unforgiven sin a weapon in Satan's hand?" This is why: the name
"Satan" means "accuser." Satan's main job is to accuse

you of sin before
God. Remember in the book of Job, Satan presented himself before God and
accused Job of being a faker, of only trusting God because God had blessed him?
That's what Satan does: he 

_accuses_

. Revelation 12:10 says this about our
enemy:

__

_"The accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses
them day and night before our God."_

Satan is the prosecuting
attorney, if you will, in the courtroom of God's heaven, and night and day he
proceeds with his case against you. And when you stand before God on that final
day, if Satan can prove your sin against you, you're done. Case closed;
verdict: guilty; sentence: death. If Satan's got unforgiven sin on you, you're
going to burn with him.

This is Satan's deadly
weapon. All of his other schemes only serve this end: to get you into that
courtroom with unforgiven sin. That's why his demons possess people: to keep
them utterly enslaved to sin and unable to turn to God to find forgiveness.
That's why he afflicts with trials and temptations: he wants to get you to
curse God for your trials and shipwreck your faith in the midst of suffering.
That's why he blinds unbelievers to the gospel: it's not ultimately spiritual
blindness that will destroy a person; it's being found guilty at the judgment
of ignoring Jesus and scorning his beauty. You see, at the end of the day,
Satan can't actually do anything eternally destructive; the only weapon he has
is to throw your sin in God's face and say, "This criminal is guilty and you're
a just judge, so you have to punish him!" And God, who is a holy and just
Judge, will certainly punish if that's the case. Satan knows he's ultimately
powerless as a creature before the Creator, and he knows that his ultimate end
is destruction in the lake of fire (Revelation 12:12); his master plan is to
use God's justice to drag as many people down to hell with him as he possibly
can. That's his only deadly weapon.

THE DEVIL'S DECISIVE DEFEAT

Here's the good news of the
gospel as it relates to this enemy: "The reason the Son of God appeared was to
destroy the works of the devil." Jesus Christ appeared in history to rout the
kingdom of darkness and to turn Satan's scheme back on himself by using that
weapon against him. If Satan can justly condemn a person to death because of
unforgiven sin, then the Savior would let Justice's sword fall on him. He took
on humanity "so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power
of death, that is, the devil" (Hebrews 2:14).

Unforgiven sin is the only
weapon with which Satan can destroy a person, and that is the one weapon that
was finally and decisively taken out of his hands at the cross for everyone who
trusts in Jesus. For all who trust in Jesus, their sin was taken out of Satan's
hands and nailed to the cross. Colossians 2:13-15 says it this way:

__

_And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision
of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our
trespasses..._

How? How did God bring us
to spiritual life and forgive all our sins? By sweeping them under the rug of
the universe? By saying, "We'll let bygones be bygones?" No, that would be
unjust; the judge couldn't do that and remain a good judge. If God simply let
sin slide, Satan would win; injustice and evil would have triumphed, and now
Satan would be able to put God in the dock and accuse 

_him_

of failing to
uphold justice in the universe. So how is forgiveness possible?

__

_...having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of
debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing
it to the cross._

The record of debt that
stood against us was the record of our sin. Revelation 20 says that the entire
sum of all our thoughts and deeds is recorded in heaven, and one day those
books will be opened. How horrifying a thought is that? If all your deepest
darkest secrets and thoughts were to be broadcast in a room with all your
friends and family, you would probably run out of that room and just keep
running, out of shame, humiliation, and guilt. So how would you feel if that
same record was opened and read by the Holy God himself, the Judge of all the
earth? That would be devastating. That's why Paul says that our record of debt
"stood against us with its legal demands." The just penalty for treason against
the King of the universe is death and hell.

It is this debt, loaded
with that legal demand, which the Father nailed to the cross. Our sentence was
executed in the person of his Son, our guilt borne by the sinless One, our
punishment falling on the innocent, our debt paid in full by heaven's Prince,
Satan's weapon wielded against the Savior, until all the claims of justice
against us had been exhausted by his perfect offering. Remember the verse of
that great hymn, "It Is Well?"

My sin, O the bliss of this glorious thought!

My sin, not in part, but the whole,

Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more;

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

All my sin is forgiven and
gone, the words "Paid In Full" written over my debt in blood. But what does all
of this have to do with Satan? Remember, as the Accuser in the courtroom of
heaven, if he can prove you guilty of unforgiven sin, you're doomed. But because
of the cross, no accusation against you can ever stick. He can open up your
record of debt and point out every single transgression and sin, but next to
every item are the words "Paid in Full." 

This is Satan's ultimate
humiliation: his one weapon taken out of his hands. He can rage and threaten
and accuse (and he still does!), but he is powerless to change the verdict that
was rendered at the cross: NOT GUILTY. That's why Colossians 2 continues:

__

_This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers
and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him._

"Rulers and authorities" is
Paul's shorthand for "Satan and all his demonic forces" (see Ephesians 6:12 and
Colossians 1:16). At the cross, the devil was disarmed, Satan shamed, because
his one damning weapon was taken out of his hands and driven through the wrists
of the Son of God. The fangs have been ripped out of the lion's mouth. He still
prowls around and roars, but the worst he can possibly do to a believer is gum
you to death with his toothless persecutions... and then you win. The great
victory of Romans 8 is written over your life with verdict-reversing,
blood-bought finality:

__

_Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who
justifies! Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died---more than that,
who was raised---and is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for
us... In all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us._

More than conquerors---that
means that every obstacle and trial and sin and temptation isn't just defeated;
they're all turned around and made to serve our everlasting good and the glory
of the Savior. Every danger, toil, and snare now only spotlights the amazing
grace that has secured our safe arrival at our heavenly homes. Even when we
fall into sin, we are not defeated. Even in your sin, Satan is still the
defeated one. I love how Martin Luther, the great instigator of the Protestant
Reformation, approached this reality. Through his pre-conversion and
post-conversion life, he struggled with a deep awareness of his own sin, and
was thus often tempted to despair and discouragement. This is what he learned:

"When the devil throws your
sins in your face and declares that you deserve death and hell, tell him this:
'I admit that I deserve death and hell; what of it? For I know One who suffered
and made satisfaction on my behalf. His name is Jesus Christ, Son of God, and
where he is, there I shall be also!'"

This good news is perhaps
best summed up in the beautiful words of the hymn, "Before the Throne of God
Above":

When Satan tempts me to despair

And tells me of the guilt within,

Upward I look and see Him there

Who made an end of all my sin.

Because the sinless Savior died,

My sinful soul is counted free,

For God the Just is satisfied

To look on Him and pardon me!

__

_Holy Spirit, Help me to lift my eyes upward to see my Savior and
see the defeat and disarmament of all my foes. Help me to see sin defeated and
swallowed up in an ocean of redeeming blood; help me to see the world crucified
to me and I to it by the superior beauty of his sacrifice; and help me to count
myself forgiven, righteous, accepted, beloved, and free from all of Satan's
accusations---as I really am in him._
