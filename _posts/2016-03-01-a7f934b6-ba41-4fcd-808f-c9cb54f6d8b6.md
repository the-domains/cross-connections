DONALD TRUMP AND THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4ad65f1d-2379-45da-a4af-ce6acb30c208.jpg)

Okay, full disclosure:
this post is not really about Donald Trump, at least not until the very end.
This is more about God's overarching purposes for history, where America and
the American church fit into that, and then (on a very tangential level), what
that means as we participate in the current election season. I believe that
America and the American church are at a critical moment in our history, a
moment where we will either move towards validating the very purpose for our
existence as a nation and a church, or forfeit our purpose and the prosperity
that has served it.

Let me explain: I believe
that the reason that God in his sovereignty has ordained that America and the
American church exist, in their current freedom and prosperity, is to fund the
completion of the Great Commission. That's it---that is literally why America
exists as a nation. Or, to put it more accurately, the reason that America has
been given unprecedented freedom and prosperity is so that the American church
can mobilize for that mission and leverage its freedom and prosperity to reach
the nations.

That's a fairly radical
statement, so please permit me a few minutes to elaborate and defend it. I have
three observations about history and world events for you to consider:

First, the overarching
purpose and meaning of history is that God is gathering worshippers for his Son
from every tribe and language and people and nation. That is why the universe
exists, and that is why history, in its seemingly circuitous and meandering
form, exists. From the opening pages of history, when God created a people "to
declare his praise" (Isaiah 43:21) who then rebelled, all of history has been
about God re-creating a people for that purpose. From his promise to bless all
the nations of the world through Abraham's offspring (Genesis 12:3), to his promise that to one
of Judah's descendants would come "the obedience of the peoples" (Genesis
49:10), to the promise of a Savior whose ever-expanding government of peace
would fill all creation (Isaiah 9:7), to Great Commission of making disciples
from every people group, to the final culmination of history when "a great
multitude that no one could number from every nation, from all tribes and
peoples and languages" (Revelation 7:9) will worship the Lamb who was slain,
this is the overarching purpose of history. The arc of the history is long, but
it bends towards worship. 

In fact, Jesus himself
gave this very reason---the redemption of people from every people group---as the culminating
purpose of history, the completion of which will usher in the end of history. Matthew
24:14: "This gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole
world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." When every
nation and people group has been reached with the gospel, history will have
fulfilled its purpose, and the end will come. That means that all 12,000 or so
ethno-linguistic people groups (that's what the word "nations" means)
will most assuredly be penetrated by the gospel before Jesus returns.

This means that if we want
to talk about the purpose of any nation or moment in history, it all has to do
with this one overarching story: God is gathering worshippers for his Son from
every tribe and language and people and nation. That's the first observation
about history for you to consider. 

Second, for the first time
in world history, we are approaching the completion of that task, the
completion of Great Commission. At the current rate of missionary expansion
into unreached people groups, the Great Commission could be fulfilled in our
lifetimes. This means that, really for the first time in church history, we are
in the position to fulfill the primary prerequisite for Jesus' return, and see
the King come back for his Bride made ready from every people group on the
planet. But the task remaining, while doable within our lifetimes, will be
exceptionally costly, both in resources and lives; the remaining unreached
people groups are those that are most hostile to the gospel, and it will take a
massive investment of resources and missionary and financial martyrs to reach
them. 

My third and final
observation is this: in all of history's circuitous ramblings, America and the
American church stand out as unique and peculiar oddities. Never before in the
history of the world has there been a nation with such freedom, and never
before has there been a nation with such prosperity. This means that in the
entire history of the world, God's people in one country have never been so
wealthy, both politically and materially. Both our freedoms and our prosperity are
literally unparalleled and unprecedented in all of world history.

Those three observations--
the purpose and goal of world history, the approaching completion of the Great
Commission, and the unique place of America and the American church in world
history-- lead me to what I think is a pretty straightforward conclusion: the
reason that God has ordained that America and the American church exist, at
this moment in history and in their current prosperity and freedom, is to fund
the completion of the Great Commission. It is "for such a time as
this" that God has ordained that the prosperous American church exists. That is why you are here.

This gives us our first
glimpse as to what this all has to do with the 2016 election (and Donald
Trump). We'll return to this theme later, but for now, a simple observation
will suffice. The slogan, "Make America Great Again" is a great theme. But to
that theme, Christians should add a "why." Why make America great again? To
what purpose? For what reason, if any, might God be pleased to 'make America
great again?' The answer, I believe, is that the only reason God made America
great in the first place, and may may perhaps condescend to make/keep her great
again, is so that the American church within her would have the freedom and
prosperity to move out on sacrificial, risk-taking mission to take the gospel
to the nations.

But this brings me to
another, different observation. As I observe our country and culture, I see
what many Christians see: that America is, with increasing velocity, slipping
off of its foundations, the biblical principles that enabled it to become great
at all. Everyone can see this; even Donald Trump agrees with me (although I don't
agree with him). But don't get me wrong: I don't believe this country has ever
truly been a "Christian nation," even if it was founded on Christian
principles, and I have no interest in waging a culture war to try to "win
America back" to some fictional glory days of our more religious past. This is
more of an observation of fact: we are quickly losing the last vestiges of
Christianity's cultural heritage in this country. But from that simple
observation, I draw a surprising conclusion: while I weep and shudder for what
that means for the American nation, I believe this is the best possible news
for the American church. 

Here's why: for just about
all of our history as a nation (a history, if you remember, which exists for
the sole purpose of fulfilling the Great Commission), the American church has
been saddled with a toxic intertwining of faith and political life, a cold
civic religion, a "God & country," "guns & Bible" mythology that has
sapped the lifeblood and vitality from Christ's true church. Even today, about
75% of Americans still self-identify as "Christian" (even though only about a
third attend church with any regularity and only a quarter identify as
evangelical). This means that the genuine, regenerate church of Jesus Christ
has been saddled with a dead weight of at least half the population, filling
our pews, diluting our membership, killing our witness, and distracting our
mission. Of course, that isn't to say that genuine believers and true churches
have never sinned grievously; but is it any wonder that the world thinks
Christians don't practice what we preach if a full two-thirds of all "Christians"
in America are not really regenerate but only bear the name? No wonder the
American church is a mile wide and an inch deep, materially wealthy and
spiritually poor.

This is why I think our
cultural shift is such good news for the church. For the past decade, the
percentage of Americans who self-identify as Christians has been dropping by
about one percent a year (that's more than three million every year!). On the
face of it, that's a frightening and discouraging statistic. But when you drill
down into the numbers, something surprising emerges: the percentage of
Americans who attend church regularly, believe the Bible, confess Jesus as
their personal Savior, and identify as evangelical hasn't really budged. We're
not growing, for sure, but neither are we undergoing a demographic exodus or
collapse. So where are the three million annual ex-Christians coming from?

They're coming from the
ranks of nominal Christians, the spiritual dead weight of the American church
who maybe show up on Christmas and Easter and check "Christian" on the survey
box, but otherwise have nothing to do with the kingdom. As the culture shifts
away from Christianity, church attendance is no longer a status marker and faith
affiliation is less and less important, and so millions of people are shedding
the fiction that they are "Christians" and are more and more comfortable
identifying as secular---which is how they were living anyway.

This means that the dead
weight is falling away from the true church, and over the coming decade, as
another thirty million people (if the trends continue) toss away their nominal
Christian status, the result should be a clarified witness, renewed vitality,
and reenergized mission. A renewed American church still prosperous and free
will be a powerful force for good in the world.

That is, if we can manage
to get our act together before our narrow window of opportunity closes. There
is a fallout that I haven't mentioned yet, a consequence that flows logically
from a culture that has abandoned the Christian faith. That fallout is
persecution. In many ways, mainstream culture has already turned against
biblical Christianity, and law necessarily follows culture. Where there is
increasing hostility now, soon there will be oppression, exclusion, and
possibly violence. It is unavoidable now that we are living in a non-Christian
society; the fact that we have escaped it for several generations is a brief
respite from the normal experience of God's people all around the world and
throughout history.

So, that's where we are at
this moment in history: the American church is undergoing a renewal as nominal
Christians slough off into secularism, and yet we probably have a window of
time---a decade or two maybe?---until persecution begins to really set in and strip
us of the freedom and prosperity that God has given us for the express purpose
of reaching the nations. For a narrow window of time we will have both vigorous spiritual life and
the practical means with which to reach the lost. But the window of freedom is closing;
if we do not begin mobilizing our churches to fulfill our great global purpose _now_, we will miss this opportunity, and
God will pass us over and accomplish his mission by other means. 

So, American Church, that
means the time is now: the time to cast aside our America-first, security- and
comfort-oriented political outlooks and embrace radical kingdom living with the
resources that God has given to us. We will not have those resources for long.
So for this moment in history, for such a time as this, God has placed his
Great Commission---along with all the resources we need to fulfill it---into our
hands. The question is, will we rise to the occasion, or succumb to the stupor
of prosperity, the desire for comfort and security, and the allure of earthly
kingdom-building?

Enter Donald Trump. Viewed
against this backdrop of God's global and historical purposes, this
foul-mouthed, psuedofascist demagogue is much more than a charlatan and a bully
(although he certainly is those things). He is more than merely a threat to our
American democracy (although I believe he is that too). Much more dangerously,
he stands at the crossroads of history and offers the American church the wide,
easy road of political power and continued shelter in our bubble of self-centered
prosperity. To the unreached nations at our doorstep, the homeless strangers
with whom Jesus identifies, whom God is bringing for the express purpose of
hearing the gospel from us, he calls us to shut our borders, bar the doors, and
close our hearts. In the face of Jesus' call to take up our crosses and follow
him, Trump promises to "protect Christianity" and give us back our lost "power."
In a moment of historic significance that calls for the church of Jesus Christ
to rise with sacrifice, self-denial, and radical, risk-taking love for the
nations, Donald Trump allures us with a false political gospel of indulgence,
selfishness, and "winning."

Brothers and sisters, this
is a lie. Like the serpent who promised Jesus an earthly kingdom if only he
would bow, Donald Trump is a snake, a false savior, a Satanic diversion from
the mission that our Savior has for the American church in this hour. Not only
is he a huckster and a fool who cannot follow through on even one of the inane
promises he has made, he is a danger and a distraction from the purposes for
which God has ordained the American church. Turning our back on
these purposes will not make America great again, nor make the American church
great again.

This is the crossroads of
history at which we now stand. In one direction, Jesus offers his church the
narrow, difficult road of suffering, hardship, sacrifice, obedience, and glory.
Down the other road, the American church keeps desperately trying to cling to
power until our window of mission opportunity shuts, persecution descends, and
the freedom and prosperity that we trusted in are taken away.

A mission to all peoples, completion
of the Great Commission, the fulfillment of history, and the King of nations as
our reward... or Donald Trump. American church, which mission, which savior will
you choose?
