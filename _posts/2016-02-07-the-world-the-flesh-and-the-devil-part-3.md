**Put on the whole armor of
God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. ~Ephesians
6:11**

Part 1 and Part 2 of this
book each had three chapters dedicated to the world, the flesh, and the devil.
Part 1 laid out a biblical understanding of each of these enemies, so that we
would know them better and engage them more fully. Part 2 showed how each of
these enemies was decisively disarmed at the cross, and that the gospel is the
main weapon we have in our fight. Part 3 is dedicated to some practical
application of these truths, but if you looked at the Table of Contents, you
may have noticed two discrepancies: Part 3 only has two chapters, and we're
starting with the chapter on the demonic first instead of last.

The reason for those two
discrepancies is two-fold. First, as you'll see in the next chapter, the
strategy against worldliness and the flesh is actually one single strategy, one
war waged at the level of desires. And the second reason we're tackling
practical battle strategies against the demonic first instead of last is
different: I don't want the last chapter in this book to be about Satan; he
doesn't deserve that place of honor. The last word in this book, as in all of
life, should be Jesus: his glory, his beauty, his power. I want this book to
end on a note, not of war, but of worship. And so we're going to reorder this
final section, just to put Satan in his proper place, and exalt Jesus to his
rightful position.

There are many different
directions we could go with this chapter. We could further explore how Satan
can gain a foothold in your life through things like anger and unforgiveness
(Ephesians 4:26-27). We could flesh out better prayer strategies against the
demonic. But this book can't be all things to all people, or it will end up
being a thousand pages long. So I will content myself to unpack the central
"marching orders" that we're given in our fight against the demonic: the "armor
of God" in Ephesians 6\. What we'll find in looking carefully at these battle
strategies is that the call to put on the whole armor of God is nothing more
than a call to equip yourself with the gospel.

__

_Finally, brothers, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of
his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against
the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but
against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over
this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly
places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore,
having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of
righteousness, and as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by
the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with
which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the
helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that
end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,
and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to
proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains,
that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak. ~Ephesians 6:10-20_

3 times there in the first
4 verses, Paul reiterates our orders as followers of Christ: stand firm. Did
you see that? Verse 11- "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
stand." Verse 13- "Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand,
therefore."

Stand! Withstand! Stand
firm! Stand! The repeated insistence of this command tells me that this must be
important. This battle that we are in is not primarily an offensive battle, but
defensive. Victory will be achieved by standing firm, by holding our ground, by
not surrendering or retreating. And to stand firm, we must be properly
equipped- that's why I want to spend the majority of this chapter just unpacking
the armor that God has given us in this fight.

THE STRENGTH OF HIS MIGHT

But I can't help point out
one thing before we get to the armor. Look at the first command again: "Be
strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of
God." The one who is on our side in this battle is God himself. 

That might seem obvious
again, but stop and let this sink in. The God who made heaven and earth with a
word, the God who sustains the universe by the word of his power, the One who
numbers the stars and the hairs on your head---he is on our side. The infinite,
eternal, omnipotent, Almighty Lord of hosts. The One who spoke, and demons
trembled and obeyed. The One through whom and for whom all things exist.

Consider what Colossians 1
says about his power. Speaking of Jesus, it says,

__

_"By him all things were created, in heaven and on earth,
visible and invisible---whether thrones or rulers or authorities---all things were
created through him and for him."_

Of all the things to
specifically mention that were created by Jesus and exist for Jesus, Paul says,
"Thrones, rulers, authorities---that is, the rulers, the authorities, the
cosmic powers over this present darkness---even they exist for Jesus and will
serve his glory."

This battle is not a battle
of equals. This is not a yin-yang duality struggle. On one side you have Satan,
who prowls around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. And on the
other side, the Sovereign Lord of the universe, in whose hand are all things,
including Satan. He is the one who created all things and for whom all things,
including Satan, exist; who disarmed the rulers and authorities on the cross,
who gives us the victory. In 2 Thessalonians 2:8 it says that on the last day,
Jesus will appear to finally do away with the anti-Christ and Satan and all the
forces of evil. And this is how he's going to do it: 

__

_"And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord
Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the
appearance of his coming."_

Satan goes down with poof---a
breath from the mouth of the Lord Jesus, and all evil is brought to nothing and
annihilated by his appearance. All that Jesus has to do is just show up, and
the brilliance of his glory will scatter darkness forever. That's just one example
of why, again, I didn't want to end this book with a word on Satan but with a
word on Jesus. At the end of history, Jesus blows Satan away with an effortless
breath, and then reigns in uncontested glory forever. Satan doesn't get the
final word; Jesus does. That's the note I want to end the book on in the next
chapter.

This is the God who is on
our side. It's breathtaking. Romans 8:31 says, "If God is for us, who can
be against us?" To which we might answer, "Lots of people! Satan is
against me. People are against me." But not successfully. If God is for
us, then no one, not even Satan himself, can be successfully against us.

In this knowledge, then,
hear verse 10 again: "Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His
might." Whose strength will win the day? God's strength. In spiritual
warfare, in your fight against sin and temptation and darkness, you do not
fight alone. The arm of omnipotence is leveraged in the defense of his people. 

We stand in God's strength,
and we fight in God's battle. This is God's battle, not ours. Reading this
passage on spiritual warfare, I'm reminded of David fighting Goliath. On his
own, he wouldn't stand a chance. But he trusted in God's strength, and knew
that he was fighting God's battle. 1 Samuel 17:47---"This day the Lord will
deliver you into my hand... that all the earth may know that there is a God in
Israel, and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword
and spear, for the battle is the LORD's."

In Matthew 16, Jesus gave
this spectacular promise: "On this rock I will build my church, and the gates
of hell shall not prevail against it." Note who is doing the building: Jesus
himself. He is the one building the church that will crush the gates of hell.
And, while we're on the subject of hell's gates, consider this: the only reason
that the church will prevail over the gates of hell is because the church's
Savior blew open those gates from the inside out when he conquered death. This
is his battle. 

****

**THE ARMOR OF GOD**

The strength is the Lord's,
the battle is the Lord's, and the armor is the Lord's too. "Put on the
armor of God." Do you see that? In the same way that this is God's
strength and God's battle, this is also God's armor. The phrase "armor of
God" doesn't just mean that this is the armor that God gives to us. This
is God's armor---this is the armor that God wears.

You see, for us to
understand what these pieces of armor mean and how to apply them and wield
them, we need to understand the imagery. Most of this armor imagery comes from
the Old Testament, and in the Old Testament, it is God himself who wears this
armor. Listen to these texts:

__

_"He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of
salvation on his head; he put on garments of vengeance for his clothing, and
wrapped himself in zeal as a cloak." ~Isaiah 59:17_

__

_"Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and
faithfulness the belt of his loins." ~Isaiah 11:5_

__

_"His faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear
the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day." ~Psalm 91:4-5_

And in Revelation, we see
Jesus himself arrayed for battle and wielding the sword of the Spirit: 

__

_"Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one
sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and
makes war. His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems,
and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. He is clothed in a
robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God...
From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations."
~Revelation 19:11-15_

This is God's armor. Jesus
wears this armor, and the way we put on this armor is, as Colossians says, to
put on Christ. He is on our side and we are united with him. We are in Christ
and therefore are a part of his battle against evil. Knowing that, we can now
turn our attention to the command to put on his armor.

THE GOSPEL APPLIED

Verse 13 says, "Take up the
whole armor of God---or, you might say, 'all of God's armor'---so that you may be
able to withstand in the evil day." We've seen that this armor is God's
armor, the armor that he himself wears and by which he reigns and makes war. So
what does each piece of the armor mean, and how do we use it? Here's what we're
going to find: each of these pieces of armor is the gospel applied. 

That makes sense, if you
think about what we've seen so far. We don't fight in our own strength and abilities,
but in God's strength. Satan was disarmed and defanged at the cross, where all
our sin was taken away. And this armor is God's armor, not ours. It's all of
God; everything here is of God, God's doing. And so it shouldn't surprise us,
as we start getting into the specifics of the armor, that the gospel---the good
news of what God has done for us---stays central.

So let's read the whole
list again to get it before us, and then take them one by one:

__

_"Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and
having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and, as shoes for your feet,
having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances
take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming
darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit, with all
prayers and supplication."_

BELT OF TRUTH

First in the list is the
belt of truth. The function of the belt in a soldier's armor was to hold the
uniform together, to hoist everything up and give the soldier mobility. If
you've ever read in the Bible the phrase, "gird up your loins,"
that's "belt" talk. To gird up your loins meant to hoist up your
robes and tie them with a belt so that you could run and move and fight.

So what does it mean to put
on the belt of truth, to gird up your loins for this fight? I think 1 Peter
1:13 is a perfect description of how the belt of truth functions: 

__

_"Therefore, girding up the loins of your mind, and being
sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at
the revelation of Jesus Christ."_

Gird up the loins of your
mind, fasten the belt of truth, by setting your hope fully on grace. Putting on
the belt of truth means getting the truth of the gospel in front of you and
anchoring your hope there. Take the hope of grace and set your mind there. Just
like a belt holds the rest of the armor together, this holds the rest of God's
armor together.

Practically, that means
memorizing gospel texts, reciting gospel truths to yourself, preaching the
gospel to yourself, living your life at the foot of the cross where your record
of debt was nailed and Satan's accusations were disarmed. Satan's accusations
and condemnations seem true, until you stand at the cross and see the record of
your debt nailed there. Then you can know the truth: my feelings of
condemnation are a lie. There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ
Jesus (Romans 8:1). Because of grace, I can repent and move on with
thankfulness and increased humility.

THE BREASTPLATE OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS

Next comes the breastplate
of righteousness. To see the gospel connection here, all we need to do is ask a
simple question: whose righteousness is this? Whose righteousness am I supposed
to arm myself with? My own? Or his? We know from Romans 4-5 that we are clothed
in the righteousness of Christ---that his obedience is credited to us. I do think
that's exactly the righteousness in mind here, because remember whose armor this
is: God's armor! This is God's righteousness. Remember Isaiah 59:17---"

_He_

put on righteousness as a breastplate." The righteousness of Christ is our
breastplate, protecting us against all the accusations of Satan. No accusation
will ever stick against those whom God has justified, because the obedience of
Jesus is ours. 

So what does this look like
practically? Isaiah 61:10 is a good place to start:

__

_"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD; my soul shall exult in
my God, for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has covered me
with the robe of righteousness."_

To put on the breastplate
of righteousness means to train your heart to thrill and rejoice and exult in
the gospel. There is no room for Satan's temptations and accusations in a heart
overflowing with gladness in grace.

SHOES

Next, "as shoes for
your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace." This
is an allusion to Isaiah 52:7: 

__

_How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings
good news- gospel- who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who
publishes salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"_

Do you see the progression
so far in the armor? Gird up the loins of your mind, setting your mind on the
hope of grace. Then fill your heart with the joy of justification. And now, put
that gospel on your feet and bring it to others. Satan is undone and defeated
when the gospel of peace moves from our heads to our hearts to our feet, and we
lay down our lives to cross mountains and cross the street with the testimony
of God's grace in our lives. That's what Revelation 12:11 says- "The
saints have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their
testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death." When the blood
of the Lamb is tracked across the world by fearless disciples who articulate
the gospel in their testimonies, Satan doesn't stand a chance.

SHIELD OF FAITH

Next is the shield of
faith. "In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you
can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one." Peter identifies
these "flaming darts of the evil one" as "fiery trials"
which the devil, who prowls around like a roaring lion, seeks to leverage to
your destruction. And the antidote? Faith. Faith protects us, guards our
hearts, and helps us persevere through trials.

But I want some more
concrete application here. So... faith in what, specifically? I think it's
really interesting that in Ephesians 6, it says the shield of faith guards
against the arrows of the evil one, and in Psalm 91 it says, "His
faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear the terror of the
night; nor the arrow that flies by day." In Ephesians 6 the shield is 

_our_

faith. And in Psalm 91 the shield is 

_his _

faithfulness. It's the exact
same imagery; it's probably the imagery that Paul is drawing on. Here's what I
infer from that: our faith is in his faithfulness. Our trust is in his ability
and commitment to keep his promises. Peter says, "Let those who suffer
according to God's will entrust their souls to their faithful Creator."
That faith in his faithfulness takes every circumstance, every fiery trial, and
sees that it is suffering according to God's will. That faith in his
faithfulness extinguishes all the enemy's designs in your suffering.

HELMET OF SALVATION

Next, the helmet of
salvation. In 1 Thessalonians 5:8, Paul gives another, shorter list of God's
armor, and there he says, "Put on for a helmet the hope of
salvation." That sounds, again, a lot like 1 Peter 1:13---"set your hope
fully on grace." Put on the helmet of salvation's hope; set your mind on
grace, fix your mind on things in heaven, where Christ is, seated at the right
hand of God. Fill your thoughts with eternity, with grace, with Jesus. Soak
your mind in God's Word until, as the battle hymn "Be Thou My Vision" says, he
is your "best thought by day or by night."

THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT

The next object in our
arsenal is the sword of the Spirit, the only offensive weapon in this list.
This imagery of the Word of God being like a sword is found throughout the
Bible. I love how Hebrews 4:12 puts it: 

__

_"The Word of God is living and active, sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and
marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart."_

That verse shows us the
first surprising way that the sword of the Spirit functions in spiritual
warfare: by making war on us. Did you see that? "Sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the
heart." The Word of God is like a battlefield medic, removing the bullet
of sin, amputating the hand that causes us to sin. God's Word is a sword for
surgery on our own treasonous hearts. 

In fact, before the sword
of the Spirit can attack Satan, it must attack us first. Ephesians 4:26 says,
"Do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the
devil." The only room that Satan has to gain a foothold in the believer's life
is through unrepentant sin. If, for example, you persist in anger and
unforgiveness, your heart is an open door for the demonic to take the reins of
your sinful desires and strengthen them into chains of oppression and bondage.
Some of the persistent patterns of sin in your life---those things that you have
struggled with and prayed about for years but can't seem to break free of---may
run deeper and stronger than mere idols and fleshly desires. These things may
require a deeper, closer level of heart examination, prayer, and repentance.
Where does that start? It starts with the weapon "sharper than two-edged sword,
piercing and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart." We need the
word of God, often wielded in the gentle hands of our brothers and sisters, to
probe our motives and sins and reveal where Satan may have taken a foothold.
Only then can the Spirit's sword be turned from surgical sword against us to
offensive weapon against the demonic.

The second way the sword of
the Spirit works is how we see Jesus using it in his dealings with Satan. Satan
kept tempting him, and he kept responding with Bible (Matthew 4). Truth is a
powerful weapon against the deceitfulness of sin and the alluring power of
temptation. So know your Bible, and know your heart. Know what temptations you
struggle with, and arm yourself with God's words, God's weapons. 

PRAYER

And lastly, prayer. We
often don't think of this one when we think of the armor of God, but it's here.
In fact, this is the most important one practically, because the very
grammatical structure of this list tells us that prayer is essential to every
one of these pieces of armor. It's a participle coming at the end of the list-
"praying at all times in the Spirit." That means that it modifies
each of the phrases that came before it: Fasten the belt of truth, praying at
all times in the Spirit. Put on the breastplate of righteousness, praying at
all times in the Spirit. Take up the shield of faith, praying at all times in
the Spirit. Take up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, praying
at all times in the Spirit. 

This is the practical
outworking of each piece of armor. We gird up the loins of our mind and set our
minds on grace, not just with Bible verses, but with prayer. We rejoice in the
gospel of Christ's righteousness by prayer. We use the word of God on our
hearts and in defense of temptation prayerfully. 

Prayer should characterize
all of our lives. Look at how all-consuming and expansive wartime prayer should
be: "praying at ALL times...with ALL prayer... with ALL perseverance for
ALL the saints." Do you get the picture? Prayer is the urgent,
all-consuming voice of spiritual warfare. The Puritan theologian Jonathan
Edwards once said, "The one concern of the devil is to keep the saints from
prayer. He fears nothing from prayerless studies, prayerless work, prayerless
religion. He laughs at our toil, he mocks at our wisdom, but he trembles when
we pray."

Why? It is because prayer
is how we appropriate the omnipotent strength of the Lord's might in this
fight. Prayer moves us beyond our simple strategies and calls in the Almighty's
firepower. Prayer is asking him for his strength, his grace, his joy, his
peace, his truth. A good way to test yourself as to how much you are relying on
God is simply by asking: how much are you praying?

You see, prayer is our
wartime walkie-talkie. John Piper said something great about this: "Prayer
is a wartime walkie talkie for spiritual warfare, not a domestic intercom to
increase the comforts of the saints." One of the reasons we are so prayerless
is because we think of prayer as a domestic intercom to summon our heavenly
butler, instead of the wartime walkie talkie that it really is. We feel pretty
comfortable and secure, and we've got plenty of money and resources to
accumulate the comforts we want... and so, honestly, we just don't see much
urgent need for prayer.

But life is war. This world
is not our home; we don't live on the home front, but rather on the front lines
of the battle. We've been slumbering in the trenches for too long, trying to
use our walkie talkies to summon the butler and wondering why he doesn't
respond.

But the good news is that
we have a heavenly General who has guaranteed our victory. Satan is a defeated,
defanged foe. He's dangerous, to be sure. But equipped with gospel armor, we
have everything we need to take our place in the battle, and see the salvation
of our God.

**Chapter 9- Starve and See**

****

**O God, you are my God;
earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a
dry and weary land where there is no water. So I have looked upon you in the
sanctuary, beholding your power and glory. Because your steadfast love is
better than life, my lips will praise you. ~Psalm 62:1-3**

This final chapter combines
the fight against worldliness and the flesh into one, because as it turns out,
there is a single strategy for engaging both these enemies. As we saw in Part
1, both worldliness and the flesh operate on the level of 

_desires_

. The
flesh is the desires of my sinful heart that love the things of the world more
than God. And worldliness is any thought or desire that does not have God as
its central frame of reference. 1 John 2:16 defines worldliness in terms of
fleshly desires:

__

_All that is in the world---the desires of the flesh and the desires
of the eyes and the pride of life---is not from the Father but is from the world._

This means that the
struggle against worldliness cannot be divorced from the struggle against the
flesh, and vice versa. In the fight against worldliness, is not enough to
simply turn off the TV and shelter your kids; worldliness flows from a 

_heart
_

that has displaced God from the center, and so the battle must take place
there. And similarly, you'll never make any progress in the fight against the
flesh if all you do is recognize root idols and probe your hidden motivations
without realizing that fleshly desires 

_feed_

on worldly things. A battle
strategy against the flesh must start with starving its desires, cutting off
its oxygen supply, by removing those worldly things which it craves.

So you can see that the
fight against worldliness and the flesh is really two sides of the same coin,
two complementary battle strategies. Both battle plans make war at the level of
desires. The Bible's strategy for victory over worldliness and the flesh can be
summed up in two words: 

_see _

and 

_starve_

. We must fight to 

_see _

the
better beauty of everything that God is for us in Jesus while simultaneously 

_starving
_

the worldly desires of the flesh.

****

**STARVING AND SEEING**

In chapter 5, we saw how
the gospel undermines the power of worldliness: it is an invitation to behold a
better beauty, to admire what is most admirable, and to be changed by what we
see. At the cross we see the glory of God shining most brightly---the glory we
were made to see and savor. To survey the wondrous cross is to find something
better than the best which the world can offer. And in doing so, we will find
ourselves disarming our flesh's most potent weapon---deceitful desires---by
exposing those desires as empty in the light of better satisfaction.

The key, then, to defeating
worldliness and the flesh is to continually and relentlessly 

_look_

. It's
not enough to just catch a glimpse of glory; the allurement of the world and
the desires of the flesh are simply too strong for a quick glance to break
every idolatrous chain. It's not enough to just skim the surface; a two-minute
devotional will not sustain the kind of self-denial and single-minded pursuit
that the Christian life calls for. This is war, and if we are going to make any
progress attacking the deeply embedded roots of worldliness in our sinful
hearts, we need to get serious about the battle.

That's one of the things I
love about the Psalms; we would do well to steep in the raw urgency and
desperation of these prayers until they become our own. In Psalm 63 we get to
listen in on the cry of a heart that has found the world unsatisfying and turns
to the sweeter taste and better beauty of everything that God is. David wrote
this prayer while on the run in the wilderness; his surroundings are a poignant
and poetic reminder that our surroundings, as comfortable and enjoyable as they
may seem, are nothing but "broken cisterns that can hold no water" (Jeremiah
2:13); they simply cannot satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts. This
chapter will be framed by the first five verses of Psalm 63, in which we'll see
our battle with the world and the flesh intertwined down to the level of our
desires. The key to defeating both is to see a superior love that satisfies.

__

_O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for
you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no
water. ~Psalm 63:1_

David's prayer opens with a
cry of hunger and thirst, a hungering and thirsting after God himself. "This
world is not enough for me," he cries. "I want more; I need you!" Is that the
cry of your heart as well? Are you longing for greater glimpses and experiences
and knowledge of Jesus? Or are you sort-of, kind-of satisfied with where you're
at and what you have? Or perhaps what you're really longing for not Jesus at
all, but more... whatever? More stuff, more popularity, more love, more comfort
and ease, more... whatever? 

The tragedy of our
comfortable, high-tech consumer culture is that we have more to enjoy and know
and experience and connect with than ever before, and yet we're more bored,
distracted, and lonely than ever. We have a wealth of information and a poverty
of attention, the newest and latest gadgets and smartphones to lust after,
bigger and better houses to live in, literally everyone on the planet to
connect to through the internet, and yet we're not satisfied. 

And in fact, the more we
give ourselves to these things, the less and less they actually give back. It's
like a drug addiction; as you give yourself to the world's toys and pursuits,
you need more and more of them to give you the same thrill. It's why heroin
users overdose; they need more and more of the drug to get the same high, until
it finally kills them. It's why you no longer like kiddie rides; when you were
two years old, the merry-go-round was the most thrilling thing you could
possibly imagine. But now you need a three hundred foot roller coaster to get
the same level of excitement. And it's why marriages disintegrate into affairs;
the relationship that used to mean so much to you gets less and less satisfying
until, driven by your desires, you start looking elsewhere to get the same
level of emotional connection. Our hearts are restless, yawning chasms that
will devour and devour our idols until they kill us.

And at the same time, while
our insatiable appetites are pursuing worldly things and getting
ever-diminishing returns from them, we find our desire and appetite for God and
his kingdom weak and growing weaker. Why is that? John Piper, in his book "A
Hunger For God," diagnoses our problem as one of feeding the wrong desires: "If
you don't feel strong desires for the manifestation of the glory of God, it is
not because you have drunk deeply and are satisfied. It is because you have
nibbled so long at the table of the world. Your soul is stuffed with small
things, and there is no room for the great."

It's kind of like me every
year at Thanksgiving. In my family, we sit down for our Thanksgiving feast
mid-afternoon, but until then we have lots of little snacks and appetizers set
out to keep us occupied during the parade: crackers, cheese, dip, etc. And year
after year, I make the same mistake: in my lack of self-control, I stuff my
face on cheese and crackers, and find that when I sit down for the feast, I
don't have as much of an appetite anymore. And when you're full from cheese and
crackers, the green bean casserole and mashed potatoes just don't taste as good
anymore.

That's our problem with our
relationship to the world. We have stuffed our souls with small things---with
television, with sports, with relationships, with Facebook---so that there is no
room left for great things---God's purposes, his glory, his love, his Son, his
gospel. And because we've nibbled at the cheese and crackers of the world for so
long, when we open our Bibles and behold the gospel feast, we don't have an
appetite for the beauty that is there.

PUT YOUR DESIRES ON A DIET

The more you feed your
flesh's desires for the things of the world, the stronger those desires will
get (and the less they will satisfy), and your desires for the things of God
will grow correspondingly weaker. The solution to our lack of appetite for
spiritual things, then, is the same as dealing with my lack of appetite for a
Thanksgiving feast: we need to put our desires on a diet. To defeat the
deceitful desires of the world and the flesh, we must starve those desires.

That's exactly the remedy
that Paul recommends in Galatians 5\. Here's the whole section in which he deals
with the flesh's desires, which we'll unpack in detail before returning to
Psalm 63:

__

_But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the
desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and
the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each
other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by
the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident:
sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife,
jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness,
orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those
who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the
Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And those who
belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
~Galatians 5:16-24_

Walk by the Spirit, Paul
says, and you will not gratify---feed---the desires of the flesh. What does it mean
to "walk by the Spirit?" We're given clarity in the next sentence, because Paul
goes on to define walking by the Spirit in terms of the "desires of the
Spirit." His argument goes like this: "You won't feed the desires of the flesh
if you walk by the Spirit, because the desires of the Spirit are opposed to the
desires of the flesh." Walking by the Spirit, then, means choosing to side with
and cultivate the desires of the Spirit, and simultaneously beginning to starve
the desires of the flesh. This is the strategy of the entire Christian life
summed up in a sentence.

Before we look more closely
at what the Holy Spirit desires, two immensely practical observations are
necessary. The first thing to see is that it is impossible to feed both desires
simultaneously, and the second is that all those "deeds of the flesh" flow from
the "desires of the flesh."

YOU CAN'T FEED BOTH

"The desires of the flesh
are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh,
for these are opposed to each other." That means that you can't simultaneously
feed the desires of the flesh and the desires of the Spirit. You can't stoke a
fire and pour water on it at the same time and hope for any progress. That may
seem obvious to point out, but oh how insidious is my flesh in this area! How
often I reason with myself, "I will have my quiet time this morning, but first
let me spend fifteen minutes on Facebook," only to find that suddenly all my
morning free time has been consumed by my flesh's desires and there's no more
time for God? Why is that? It's because you can't feed the flesh's desires and
then expect your flesh to push back from the table and say, "Okay, I'm
satisfied now, you can go and feed the Spirit now." Facebook will never satisfy
your flesh's insatiable desire for community and connection, and so like a
ravenous animal it will keep demanding more and more. Or perhaps a better way
to describe it would be like a little child saying, "Five more minutes! Five
more minutes!" That seems much more tame, much more innocent. Our flesh really
is a ravenous animal, but the voice in our head seems so reasonable, so
innocent, that we usually don't even try resisting; we just go along with our
urges and before you know it, there's no more room for God.

That's just one example
from my typical morning routine; I could go on and on with a million more. If
your sinful heart desires control---a desire that often manifests itself in
outward behaviors like anxiety---you can't expect to indulge your worry for a
whole day and then open your Bible and see passages about the sovereignty of
God as beautiful and precious. Why not? Because you've spent the whole day
feeding your desire for control, and so the last thing your flesh wants to do
is gladly relinquish control to a better master.

The thing is, the Bible's
teaching on the sovereignty of God is the sword that will slay the desire for
control. But could it be that the reason our simple, trite strategies aren't
working---"Oh, you struggle with worry? Here are three verses to encourage you
about how God is in control!"---is because we think we can feed both sets of
desires? In order for those Bible passages about God's sovereignty to start
really functioning with flesh-defeating power, you have to stop feeding your
flesh's desire for control and instead begin diligently pursuing the Spirit's
desire to gladly let God be in control. 

Here's what I mean
practically: when the desire for control starts rising in your heart---it may emerge
with thoughts like, "How am I going to get all of this done today?" or "Why
can't he ever show up on time?" or "There's no way we'll be able to pay this
bill!"---don't indulge it and let your thoughts and emotions begin sliding down
that hill and snowballing into a panic attack, anger, or discouragement.
Recognize that thought for what it is---a fleshly desire for control---and
immediately attack it with the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God (Ephesians
6:17). When your flesh asks for control, shove a verse about God's sovereignty
down its throat instead. Your internal conversation with yourself could go
something like this:

Flesh: "How am I going to
get this done today!?"

You: "I don't need to be in
control of my schedule; Isaiah 33:6 says that Jesus 'will be the stability of
your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of the LORD
is Zion's treasure.' He is everything I need today."

Flesh: "But I wanna be in
control! I need to start whining, pouting, and hyperventilating!"

You: "Hebrews 13:5- 'He has
said, 'I will never leave you or forsake you.' So we can confidently say, 'The
Lord is my helper; I will not fear, what can man do to me?'"

Flesh: "Humph. I hate that.
I don't want to believe that."

You: "Why are you downcast,
O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again
praise him, my salvation and my God (Psalm 42:5)."

Flesh: \*muffled whimpering\*

And then, an hour later,
when your flesh picks up its head and asks for control again, repeat the process.
It will be slow-going at first; your flesh is probably not used to being
refused and will fight back. But don't get discouraged in the battle. Over
time, as you relentlessly put your trust in God's promises and combat the
flesh's deception with his truth, its voice will slowly get weaker, and the
Spirit's voice will get stronger. This is what it means to "put to death the
deeds of the flesh" (Romans 8:13).

DEEDS FLOW FROM DESIRES

The second practical
insight to glean from Galatians 5 is that all those "works of the flesh" that
Paul lists in verse 19 ("sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry,
sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions,
divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these") are not the real
problem; they are only symptoms of the real problem. The real problem is the
desires. The desires of the flesh manifest themselves in the deeds of the
flesh; desires are the root, deeds are the fruit.

James traces this
connection in the fourth chapter of his letter. All the outward manifestations
of the sinful flesh, he argues, are just the outworking of a heart in love with
the world:

__

_What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not
this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so
you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel... You
adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity
with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an
enemy of God. ~James 4:1-2,4_

What causes those deeds of
the flesh that Paul listed in Galatians 5---enmity, jealousy, anger, etc? What
causes sinful behavior like quarreling or fighting or murdering? The answer is 

_desires_

.
"You desire and don't have... you covet and cannot obtain." These are what birth
sinful behaviors.

James is just expanding on
what Jesus himself said:

__

_"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good
fruit, for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from
thorn bushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. The good person out of
the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his
evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaks." ~Luke 6:43-45_

Out of the abundance of the
heart, the mouth speaks, Jesus says. What comes out of your mouth is not
ultimately caused by your circumstances or what that person just said to you;
your response to these things flows from what you treasure---i.e., what you
desire---in your heart. If, for example, your heart is attached to the idolatry
of looking good in front of people, then when you are criticized, what comes
out of your mouth will be anger, or condescension, or discouragement. Those
outward signs are not the main issue; that's just the fruit of what you really
desire in your heart. 

If you find yourself
frequently lashing out at people in anger, what you need is not behavior
modification---"stop yelling at people!"---or coping techniques---"take three slow
breaths"; what you need is 

_desire _

modification. You need to uncover the
idol of control or praise or whatever it is in your heart. You'll often need
the help of others to see your own heart clearly---that's why Hebrews 3:13 says
"exhort 

_one another _

every day, that none of you may be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin." Our own views of ourselves are often distorted and
inaccurate; that's one of the effects of the sinful nature. We need the help of
trusted brothers and sisters in Christ who can gently and patiently ask
questions and give gracious, firm observations that help us dig down to the
root of the problem. Once you've discovered what you really desire and
treasure, then you can start attacking that desire using the sword of the
Spirit, like we examined earlier. 

Jesus' picture of a tree is
a really helpful illustration, because so much of our efforts to change seem to
completely ignore what he says about desire and behavior. Trying to change your
behavior without uncovering the root idol that is driving that behavior is like
trying to staple apples onto a thorn bush and calling it an apple tree. It
might work for a couple days, and you might even fool a couple people with your
new-and-improved behavior, but those apples will soon wither and the true nature
of the thorn bush will shine through again. Or it's like weeding your garden;
if your solution to weeds is just to mow over them but never get down on your
hands and knees to yank them up by the roots, your flower bed will look good
for a couple days, but the weeds will grow right back. You didn't attack them
at their roots, so they actually grow up stronger the next time. So it is with
our behaviors; the only way to change the fruit is by going after the root.
Jesus and James and Paul all point us to the root and hand us a bottle of weed
killer: attack the insatiable desires of our flesh by starving those desires
and instead feeding the desires of the Spirit.

THE DESIRES OF THE SPIRIT

So what exactly are "the
desires of the Spirit" that Paul talks about in Galatians 5? This is where
we're going to begin pivoting back to Psalm 63 where we started; up until this
point, most of this chapter has been focused on the negative---the sinful
desires, not feeding them, etc. But we can't merely starve sinful desires; our
hearts were created to crave, so it's impossible to just "turn off" bad desires
without actively cultivating good ones to replace them. If we're not actively
feeding godly desires while muffling sinful ones, we won't actually experience
victory. So what are these Holy Spirit desires that we must pursue?

One thing that "the desires
of the Spirit" 

_aren't _

is the fruit of the Spirit. Those are not
synonymous. Don't get them confused: when Paul says "Walk by the Spirit and
feed the desires of the Spirit" he's not saying, "Be loving and joyful and
peaceful and patient and kind." Remember, the fruit flows from the root; the
deeds flow from the desires. Just like the deeds of the flesh flow from the
desires of the flesh, the fruit of the Spirit flows from the root of godly
desires. To "walk by the Spirit" isn't a call to just do the right things; it
is a call to 

_love_

the right things. Which is a lot harder.

In order to know what the
"desires of the Spirit" are, I propose asking the Bible a simple question: what
does the Holy Spirit love? He's a person, after all---the third Person of the
Trinity---who can rejoice (Luke 10:21) and grieve (Ephesians 4:30). So what does
he love to do?

That question is worthy of
a whole book on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, so I'll content myself with
one simple answer: He loves to make much of Jesus by showing him off to our
hearts.

__

_He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it
to you. ~John 16:14_

The Holy Spirit loves to
glorify Jesus---to point to him and make much of him---and Jesus says that the
Spirit does that in a specific way: "he will take what is mine and declare it
to you." That means the Spirit takes Jesus' love and declares it to us; he
takes Jesus' power and declares it to us; he takes Jesus' meekness and majesty
and holiness and humility and declares it to us. He speaks through his Word
(compare Ephesians 5:18-20 and Colossians 3:16-17 for more on the relationship
between the Spirit and the Word) and opens up the eyes of our heart to see
Jesus shining off of its pages in all his superior glory and better beauty.
This is the primary work of the Holy Spirit in our lives: showing us more and
more of Jesus to see and savor and celebrate. He loves to behold the beauty of
the Son; that's what he desires. And it's that desire which Paul says we must
feed.

BEHOLD A BETTER BEAUTY

And now, as promised, we're
back to Psalm 63\. This psalm is simply an echo of the desire of the Spirit: to
see and savor more of Jesus. Feeding the desire of the Spirit means cultivating
longings that looks like this:

__

_O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for
you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no
water. So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and
glory. Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise
you. So I will bless you as long as I live; and in your name I will lift up my
hands. My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will
praise you with joyful lips. ~Psalm 63:1-5_

In response to the empty
things around him, David's prayer is earnest and urgent: "earnestly I seek you;
my soul thirsts for you." And look at what he pursues: not doing better things,
not behavior modification, not even putting to death the deeds and desires of
the flesh. No, what he pursues is one thing: 

_seeing_

. 

"So I have looked upon you in
the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory." That right there is the whole
goal of the Christian life. This is what the Holy Spirit longs to do; this is
how transformation takes place. "Beholding the glory of the Lord, we are being
transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this
comes from the Lord who is the Spirit" (2 Corinthians 3:18).

The most urgent business of
your life is to behold. Not just glance, not just skim; to stare until your
soul is satisfied. I love what worship leader Matt Papa says in his excellent
book "Look & Live":

"Worship is war. The call
is to behold the Son of God, not merely look at him. It is to gaze deeply into
the gospel, not merely pray some prayer and then move on. We must linger.
Christianity is the hard, joyful journey of beholding Jesus by faith until the
day you behold him by sight."

This is where the war is
won: the fight to see. And not to just see generally, but to behold and believe
specific wonderful things about Jesus. We must fight to see his power, his
glory, and his superior steadfast love: "...beholding your power and glory.
Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you."

For me, this is what my
entire devotional life is about. Now, I don't claim to have this figured out
or, honestly, to have made much progress in this. Far too often the gaze of my
soul is distracted by smaller beauties and my attention is captured by lesser
things. But what I have learned in my walk with Jesus so far is that 

_nothing
_

is more important than this seeing, and that everything else in the
Christian life rises or falls to the extent to which I 

_see _

him. I used
to read the Bible for lots of different reasons: to know and obey God's
commands, to understand biblical history, to shape my worldview, to be more
like Jesus. Don't get me wrong: those are all good and valuable things. I don't
necessarily recommend ceasing to read the Bible for those reasons. But for me,
it wasn't enough. Over time, the focus of my quiet time has narrowed and
narrowed until 90% of my prayers and 100% of my Bible reading is laser focused
on one thing: I need to see Jesus. I need to see his power and glory and
steadfast love. I need to be daily persuaded that his steadfast love is better
than life. And so the vast majority of my prayers are that the Spirit would
open the eyes of my heart and help me see ("Open my eyes that I may behold
wondrous things out of your law!" Psalm 119:18), and then all of my Bible
reading is aiming at seeing until my soul is satisfied ("Satisfy me in the
morning with your steadfast love!" Psalm 90:14). 

I don't think that this
undivided pursuit is misguided. Remember how Jesus, in teaching on prayer, said,
"Ask and you shall receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be
opened to you" (Matthew 7:7)? What are we supposed to ask about and seek for
and knock at? Psalm 27:4:

**__**

**_One thing_**

have I
asked of the LORD, that I will seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the
LORD all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD and inquire
in his temple. 

The great ambition of my
life---not yet fully realized, but by his grace I'm running after it---is to make
Psalm 27:4 the banner over my life. One thing, Lord; I want just one thing: I
want to ask and seek and knock down the door of heaven in my pursuit of one
great joy: to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord today, tomorrow, and forever.

I urge you to join me in
this single-minded pursuit. If what Psalm 63:3 says is true---"your steadfast
love is better than life"---what better pursuit could there possibly be? His
steadfast, relentless love and amazing grace outweigh every other thrill and
joy and pleasure that this world has to offer. "The surpassing worth of knowing
Christ Jesus my Lord" (Philippians 3:8) makes everything else look and taste
like rubbish and loss in comparison. 

And this surpassing worth,
this better beauty, is what you were made for. You exist to see and be
satisfied by the greatness of God's glory and grace. Worship leader Matt Papa
again serves as a valuable guide:

"We were made for the Holy.
The Beyond. Our soul's attention is like one thousand laborers that need a
task---that crave a task. And the task we were made for is to mine the infinite
depths of God---to scale the mountain of his holiness and sing for joy on every
peak. Nothing else is enough. Everything else will leave us bored. There is no
end to the hunger of the soul and there is no end to God. He is the only Thing
that is always 'more.' An ocean without a shore. A mountain without a peak. The
Holy One."

This knowledge of God is
what we were made to experience and enjoy, and this knowledge is the weapon
that defeats all the strategies of the world, the flesh and the devil.

The world is defeated by
this sight of superior glory. That's why Psalm 63:5 says, in response to this
better beauty and superior steadfast love, "My soul will be 

___satisfied _

as
with fat and rich food." Feed your soul with this gospel feast, and you will
find that the world's crackers and cheese lose their appeal. Only this love,
only this greatness, only this glory, will satisfy the soul completely.
Chocolate won't make you lastingly happy. A steak dinner won't leave you
satisfied. The best cup of coffee in the world won't sustain you. Only in the
superior steadfast love of God can you exult and say, "In 

_this _

my soul
will be satisfied." Only he is enough.

The flesh is also defeated
by this superior glory. The twisted, selfish desires of my heart---what John
calls "the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and the pride of
life"---are undone and reordered in the light something so much better. How can I
keep lusting after the fading beauty an "fleeting pleasures of sin" (Hebrews
11:25), when I am looking forward to this reward that outweighs all the
competition? "Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things, and give me life
in your ways" (Psalm 119:37).

And finally, this better
beauty is the undoing and defeat of Satan as well. "Upward I look and see him
there, who made an end to all my sin," and the accusations and temptations of
Satan vanish. The third verse of "Before the Throne of God Above" captures this
victory: 

Behold him there, the risen Lamb,

My perfect, spotless Righteousness,

The King of glory and of grace.

One with himself, I cannot die;

My soul is purchased by his blood.

My life is hid with Christ on high,

With Christ, my Savior and my God!

WAR IS WORSHIP

Matt Papa said, "Worship is
war," and he is right. But the reverse is also true: war is worship. The good
fight that we are called to engage in against all three of our enemies is,
ultimately, a war of worship. The battle that rages is one for the attention
and affection of our souls. Satan says, "Bow down and worship me" (Matthew
4:9). The flesh says, "Love and serve me." The world says, "I am all there is;
desire and pursue me."

But Jesus holds out the
superior invitation of Psalm 63:3: "Because your steadfast love is better than
life, 

_my lips will praise you. _

My soul will be satisfied... and 

_my
mouth will praise you_

with joyful lips.

_" _

Worship flows to what
satisfies us. And so the ultimate way to break the chains of the world, the
flesh, and the devil, is to discover and delight in the highest Object of
worship: Jesus himself.

In 2 Chronicles 20 we are
given an incredible literal picture of this worship war. King Jehoshaphat is
facing an unbeatable army arrayed against him, impossible odds are stacked
against him, and there is no hope of victory. And so he falls on his face and
prays a humble and heroic prayer of faith:

__

_O LORD, God of our fathers, are you not God in heaven? You rule
over all the kingdoms of the nations. In your hand are power and might, so that
none is able to withstand you... We are powerless against this great horde that
is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you."_

In response to his prayer,
the word of the Lord comes to him with a promise of victory:

__

_Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed at this great horde, for
the battle is not yours but God's... You will not need to fight in this battle.
Stand firm, hold your position, and see the salvation of the LORD on your
behalf."_

And so King Jehoshaphat
does something surprising. He assembles all the priests along with his army,
and put the temple worship team in front of the army. All the singers went
before the army, praising God and singing, 

__

_"Give thanks to the LORD, for his steadfast love endures forever!"
And when they began to sing and praise, the LORD set an ambush against the men
of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come to Judah, so that they were
routed._

The front line of the
battle was praise, and the war was won with worship. Israel's three enemies
were routed when the singing started, and the army got to stand back and see
the salvation of the Lord on their behalf.

This is a picture of our
war as well. Worship of the One who is truly worthy cuts the roots of fleshly
idolatry, severs the allurement of the world, and silences the accusations and
temptations of the demonic. So, to end this book, I want to linger on worship,
using the words of those saints who have gone before us and have tasted and
seen the superior goodness of God. These are the words of those who have beheld
better beauty and been ravished by what they've seen. They have climbed the
mountain to be with God, and then come down with words that strain to describe
what they've seen, urging us to follow them up into the presence of God. One of
the great benefits of poetry and praise songs is that they articulate familiar
glory in a fresh way; some of my greatest strides in seeing and savoring Jesus
have come through hearing a new song that takes something I already knew and makes
it explode with new significance. Make these songs, poems, and prayers your
songs, your poems, your prayers, and fight the good fight of faith. Commit them
to memory, sing and pray them, wield the weapon of worship, and enter into the
joy prepared for you.

This first poem was written
by Ann Griffiths, a young woman who lived in Wales at the end of the 18th
century and died before her 30th birthday. Her short life overflowed with songs
celebrating her Beloved, the Savior who captured and widened all her longings,
and met them all with his relentless love:

Earth cannot, with all its
trinkets,

Slake my longings at this
hour;

They were captured, they
were widened,

When my Jesus showed his
power.

None but he can now content
me,

He, the Incomprehensible;

O to gaze upon his Person,

God in man made visible

Let my days be wholly
given,

Jesus' blood to glorify,

Calm to rest beneath his
shadow,

At his feet to live and
die,

Love the cross, and bear it
daily,

('Tis the cross my Husband
bore!)

Gaze with joy upon his
Person,

And unceasingly adore.

The ancient hymn, "Be Thou
My Vision," was probably written in the 700s AD, and has served as the battle
anthem of believers ever since. Two verses in particular spur on the fight to
delight in God above all earthly treasures:

Be Thou my battle shield,
sword for the fight

Be Thou my dignity, Thou my
delight;

Thou my soul's shelter and
Thou my high tower;

Raise Thou me heavenward, O
Power of my power.

Riches I heed not, nor
man's empty praise;

Thou my inheritance, now and
always.

Thou and Thou only, first
in my heart;

High King of heaven, my
treasure Thou art.

One of the most prolific
hymn writers in American history was the blind ex-slave, Fanny Crosby. Her life
was wrecked and remade by the glory that she saw in Jesus (perhaps her
blindness to earthly things helped sharpen her sight of the Savior!). She wrote
such classics as "Blessed Assurance" and "To God Be The Glory." She prayed and
set the lofty goal of one million people coming to faith through her songs. Her
hymn, "Take the World" is a powerful weapon to stir your heart to set your gaze
above earthly trinkets on the One who satisfies the soul. The last verse
recalls her oft-quoted statement, "If I had a choice, I would still choose to
remain blind... for when I die, the first face I will ever see will be the face
of my blessed Savior."

Take the world, but give me
Jesus,

All its joys are but a
name;

But His love abideth
forever,

Through eternal years the
same.

Take the world, but give me
Jesus,

Sweetest comfort of my
soul;

With my Savior watching
o'er me,

I can sing though billows
roll.

Take the world, but give me
Jesus,

Let me view His constant
smile;

Then throughout my pilgrim
journey

Light will cheer me all the
while.

Take the world, but give me
Jesus!

In His cross my trust shall
be,

Till, with clearer,
brighter vision,

Face to face my Lord I see.

This last poem, a
little-known song by a little-known author, captures the single pursuit that
sets the soul free from lesser beauty: the "sight of peerless worth":

What has stripped the
seeming beauty

From the idols of the
earth?

Not a sense of right or
duty

But the sight of peerless
worth.

Not the crushing of those
idols,

With its bitter void and
smart;

But the beaming of his
beauty,

The unveiling of his heart.

'Tis the look that melted
Peter,

'Tis the face that Stephen
saw,

'Tis the heart that wept
with Mary,

Can alone from idols draw.

The only thing powerful enough to break
Satan's temptations, disarm worldly idols and strip them of their seeming
beauty is not duty or obedience or willpower or trying harder; only a better
beauty, a "sight of peerless worth" can draw the human heart away from idols.
The only way to crush and dethrone Jesus' rivals from the throne of your heart
is to fix your eyes on "the beaming of his beauty, the unveiling of his heart."
This is the fight of faith; this is what the Savior calls us to and what he
purchased for us: a wartime lifestyle of pressing on to know him better, until
"the things of earth grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace."
May you taste and see that glory and grace in ever-increasing measure, and find
in them freedom from all your enemies.

_O Lord, unveil your heart, shine the light of
your glory and grace into my soul, and draw me away from the idols that compete
for my attention. Break my heart with the same look that melted Peter, give me
courage as I see the face that Stephen saw, meet me tenderly with the same
heart that wept with Mary. Help me to say daily, "Take the world but give me
Jesus." Enthrone yourself as First in my heart, and be my Treasure today and
always. And "let my days be wholly given, Jesus' blood to glorify," as I gladly
proclaim that you are better than anything this world has to offer. O to see
you face to face! I long for the day when my hope becomes glad fruition and my
faith becomes sight. Until that day, open my eyes to behold your beauty and
satisfy me every day with your steadfast love. Help me to fight the good fight
of faith: the fight to delight, the fight to see, the fight to be satisfied. _
