[THE WORLD, THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL][0]

At the end of his life, the apostle Paul summarized his Christian life by saying, "I have fought the good fight." Could you say the same? Or have the enemies of your soul lulled you into a comfortable cease-fire?

There is a war going on all around us- "fighting without and fear within"- and yet many Christians are walking around like there is nothing wrong, like there is no danger and no enemy. We're at war, yet we're living like we're at peace.

This book is a call to re-engage in the struggle for holiness and to fight the good fight by taking up the greatest weapon God has given us: the gospel itself. Click [here][0] to explore the book and start fighting.
