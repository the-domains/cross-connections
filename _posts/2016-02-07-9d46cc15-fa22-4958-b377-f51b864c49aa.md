**_INTRODUCTION_**

**__**

**__**

**_This is the
commandment: that you may fear the LORD your God. ~Deuteronomy 6:2_**

Fear is a
funny thing. Nobody likes to be afraid---except for when we do: roller coasters,
haunted hay rides, scary movies. Over and over again, we're commanded in the
Bible to not fear. In fact, I've been told (although I haven't done the
counting myself) that the Bible says "Don't fear" 365 times, one for every day
of the year. Apparently it's a message that we, who are so quick to fear and
lose faith, need to hear over and over again.

But
there's another thing that the Bible teaches about fear, and at first glance it
almost seems like the opposite of those 365 "Don't fear" commands. Over and
over again, we are told in Scripture to fear God. "You shall fear your God: I
am the LORD" (Leviticus 19:14). "This is the commandment: that you may fear the
LORD your God" (Deuteronomy 6:2). "Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised;
he is to be feared above all gods" (Psalm 96:4). "The fear of the LORD is the
beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 1:7). Isaiah 8:13 says it the most bluntly: "Let
him be your fear, and let him be your dread." And lest you think this is just
an Old Testament concept, consider 2 Corinthians 5:11---"Knowing the fear of the
Lord, we persuade others," or 1 Peter 2:17---"Honor everyone. Love the
brotherhood. Fear God." And of course, remember the less-than-warm-and-fuzzy comfort
that Jesus gave: "Have no fear of them... Don't fear those who kill the body but
cannot kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy
both soul and body in hell" (Matthew 10:28). Thanks, Jesus. I feel a lot better
now.

These
texts, and many more like them, are worth our sober consideration. If it's true
that God repeats things to get our attention, then we had better sit up and
take notice. This command is so prevalent throughout Scripture, it must be
important. Yet for something so important, we seem to have very vague and fuzzy
notions about what it means to fear God. And fuzzy thinking always leads to
fuzzy living; if we don't think clearly and biblically about a certain topic,
that deficient thinking will always manifest itself in deficient living and
deficient holiness. So how are we supposed to obey the command to fear God if
we're not even sure what that means? 

And
there's another problem. Fearing God seems somehow out of step with the gospel.
If God loves me and sent his Son to die for me to forgive my sins so that I
would be his child forever with my entrance to heaven secured by his grace...
where does fear fit into that? I thought "perfect love casts out fear" (1 John 4:18).
If in Christ God is now my Father, Friend, Savior, and Lover, that would seem
to leave no room for fear. And yet Jesus himself, the Great Redeemer and Good
Shepherd, tells me to fear God. Paul, who heralded the radical gospel of free
and sovereign grace more passionately than anyone, said that his gospel ministry
was propelled by "knowing the fear of the Lord."

The
saints of old seemed to know how to hold these two pieces together better than
we do. John Bunyan, who wrote 

_The
Pilgrim's Progress _

in 1678 while imprisoned for preaching the gospel,
wrote, "Christian, let God's distinguishing love to you be a motive to you to
fear him greatly." William Gurnall, a 17

th

century pastor and
author, expositing Matthew 10:28, said, "We fear men so much, because we fear
God so little. One fear cures another. When man's terror scares you, turn your
thoughts to the wrath of God." And John Newton, in his hymn "Amazing Grace,"
wrote these mysterious and profound lines: "'Twas grace that taught my heart to
fear / And grace my fears relieved." Clearly these men of God understood
something about fearing God that we, in the 21

st

century, struggle
to grasp.

So if these
two seemingly opposite things---the fear of God and the grace of God--- feel
contradictory to you, it's probably because we breathe the poisonous 21

st

century air of cheap grace far more deeply than our predecessors. If we can't
conceive of a gospel of "grace that taught my heart to fear," we have not
sufficiently encountered biblical grace.

Fortunately,
God is kind to us, and has given us a wealth of direction in his Word,
sufficient to recover the lost link between grace and fear. In my previous
book, 

_Cross Connections,_

I laid
out

what I believe is the central thesis
of the Christian life: every single thing that the Bible tells Christians to
do, believe, think, or say, is explicitly and directly, in a verse or passage,
tied to cross of Christ. Time and time again, the biblical authors draw lines
of motivation from the cross to specific areas of our lives: our love, or joy,
our purity... and our fear of God. "We love because he first loved us." "Forgive
one another as God in Christ forgave you." "You were bought at a price;
therefore honor God in your body." "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved
the church and gave himself for her." "Conduct yourselves with fear, knowing
that you were ransomed..." Nothing---not even the fear of God--- falls outside the
cross's purview.

There are
two primary biblical texts that are fueling this short volume. The first is 1
Peter 1:17-18: "Conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile,
knowing that you were ransomed..." Do you hear the connection that Peter makes?
"Conduct yourselves with fear"---in other words, fear God---

_knowing that you were ransomed_

. The kind of fear that Peter is
after is a fear filled with knowledge of Christ's ransoming work on the cross. How
does that work? What's the relationship between fear and ransom? That tension
is what I want to draw out in these pages.

The second
text driving this book is Isaiah 8:12-15\. Here it is in its entirety:

__

_Do not call
conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they
fear, nor be in dread. But Yahweh the Almighty, him you shall honor as holy.
Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he will become a sanctuary
and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap
and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many shall stumble on it. They
shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken._

This surprising
passage is a message of comfort ("Don't fear! He will be your sanctuary!")
wrapped in a message of judgment. It's about a fear of God that kills every
lesser fear, and a reckoning with an Absolute Reality that is simultaneously a
sanctuary and rock of stumbling. Once again, it's those tensions that I want to
explore here. 

To do
that, we will take a whirlwind tour through the heart of God revealed in His
Word, attempting to get glimpses of the glorious paradox that shines at the
heart of reality and, most brightly, at the cross. This book is laid out as
seven meditations on the fear of God and the gospel; some of them are extended,
and some are only a few pages. In this short volume, as we survey what the
Bible says about fearing God, we will find again and again that we are doing
nothing less than surveying the wondrous cross on which the Prince of glory
died. At first glance, the topics covered in these pages might seem scattered,
but that's intentional; it's my goal for us to see the blazing heart of God
refracted through many facets of gospel truth. As we turn the gospel diamond in
our hands to to see the cross from new angles, we'll also gain new perspectives
on what it means to fear God. My prayer for you is that, through these few
pages, God will teach your heart to sing anew,

__

_'Twas grace that
taught my heart to fear_

__

_And grace my fears
relieved;_

__

_How precious did
that grace appear_

__

_The hour I first
believed!_

**_CHAPTER 1- WRATH AND
LOVE: THE PARADOX OF GOD_**

**__**

**_Yahweh, Yahweh, a
God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and
faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty. ~Exodus
34:6-7_**

We talk a
lot about relationship with God in biblical language rich with metaphors---He is
Father, Friend, Savior, Lover, Brother, Bridegroom, etc. And yet, there used to
be a phrase that both biblical authors and saints of old used to use frequently
when talking about a relationship with God: "fearing God." But how are you
supposed to have a relationship with someone you fear? How is fear supposed to
be a component in a relationship of love? 

I think
that the best way to answer that question is to try to answer a
seemingly-unrelated question: what is God like? What is his character? Knowing
the character and personality of God is the key to understanding what it means
to fear him, so rather than initially tackle the issue of fearing God head-on,
I want to approach it through the backdoor of understanding the heart and mind
of God himself. I'm convinced that if we can get a clear sight into God's holy
heart, the reflexive response of our own hearts will be what the Bible calls
"the fear of God."

You'll
see why that approach is important when I ask a question like this: Does "fearing
God" mean that we should cower before God, like a child cowers before a bully? Should
we be terrified of setting off his hair trigger temper, like some abusive
father? Is that what "fearing God" means? Some atheists and secularists have
pointed to this frequent phrase in the Bible as proof of the inherent ugliness
of the Christian God. "What kind of god," they ask, "would demand that people be
terrified of him?"

That's
certainly a reasonable question to ask---and it's a question you should have an
answer to. The typical response that I have heard to that question goes
something like this: "Fearing God doesn't mean being afraid of him; it means
having respect for him." But while that's a helpful clarification---because the
Bible certainly doesn't teach that God is a mean, angry bully who should terrify
us, and certainly does teach that we should honor and respect him---I don't think
that fully captures the meaning of "fearing God" in the Bible. 

So on one
extreme, you have "fearing God means cowering before an angry deity;" and on
the other hand, you have "fearing God means respecting him." I think there's a
biblical middle ground here, but to uncover it will take a willingness to
submit to God's revelation of himself in the Bible. 

Before
you jump too quickly to the easy conclusion, "Of course God's not a bully, God
loves everybody!" stop and consider for a moment: when confronted with a
question like this, it is of the utmost importance that we seek to know the God
who is actually there, not just the God we want to be there. I want my view of
God to be completely shaped by his revelation of himself in his Word, not by
any presuppositions about what he does or what he's like. When I come to the
Bible, I need to come asking that my view of God be broken by his Word and
rebuilt into something more accurate. Otherwise, I will inevitably start
cherry-picking texts I like and trying to press God into my notions of what he
should be like. But when I do that, I am no longer discovering or worshipping
the true God of the Bible; I have simply created a god out of my own
imagination, a god in my own image. So let's prayerfully strive to put aside
our notions of what God should or shouldn't be like, and come humbly to his
Word, asking one simple question: what is God actually, really like?

WRATH AND
LOVE: GOD AT SINAI

There are
many ways to answer that question accurately and biblically; I am going to just
choose one. To get an accurate, full-orbed portrait of what God is like, I want
to take us to God's central revelation of himself in the Old Testament. The
entire Bible, of course, is the progressive revealing of God's purpose and
character, culminating in his final word, his Son Jesus Christ (Hebrews 1:1-2).
Throughout the Old Testament, God speaks through prophets, priests, and kings,
revealing his heart and his will as he prepares a people for his own
possession. But amidst this sweeping scope of divine revelation, there is one
particular high point, a mountaintop from which light shines on the entire rest
of the Bible. In the Old Testament, that high point of divine revelation is God
at Mount Sinai, and Exodus 33-34 in particular. This is the blazing center of
God's Old Testament revelation, the cohesive core that holds every other
prophecy, vision, poetry, and history together. If you want to know the God of
the Bible, or to understand the Old Testament better---or to know what "fearing
God" means--- start here.

A bit of
background will help bring us up to speed in the story. God has just rescued
his people from slavery in Egypt, bringing them out of captivity "with a mighty
hand and outstretched arm" (Deuteronomy 26:8). He showed his absolute
superiority over the gods of Egypt with plague after plague, and then sheltered
his people from the force of his judgment by giving them a means of escape: the
blood of a lamb who would die instead of their firstborn when God brought the
final devastating plague upon Egypt. Thus God rescued his people, and then
continued showing them the wonders of his power by cutting a path through the
Red Sea, feeding them with the bread of heaven, and opening up streams to
quench their thirst in the desert. In Exodus 19, God summarizes what he has
done for them, and the kind of relationship he wants with them:

__

_You yourselves have
seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagle's wings and
brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep
my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all peoples, for all
the earth is mine; and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy
nation. ~Exodus 19:4-6_

Next came
the ten commandments and the giving of the law, in which God lays out the
proper response to his grace, how to live as his treasured possession, and what
it means to be a "holy nation" devoted to him.

And what
is the people's response to God's gracious rescue, gracious provision, and
gracious invitation into relationship with himself? That brings us to Exodus
32\. When Moses tarries with God on the mountain, the people take matters into
their own hands. "Make us gods who shall go before us. As for this man Moses,
the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has
become of him." And so they fashion an idol, a golden calf, and declare, "These
are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!"

Stop and
feel the horror of this treason. They had seen God's mighty power with their
own hand. They had been rescued out of slavery and bondage. They had literally
just agreed to the terms of the covenant with God, the first and most important
of which was, "you shall have no other gods besides me." And at the first
moment of opportunity, they spurn their rescuer in preference for something
"new and improved."

God's
anger is swift. "Stand aside," he says to Moses, "that my wrath may burn hot
against them and I may consume them, in order that I may make a great nation of
you." The judgment against their idolatry and treason is the just decree of utter
destruction. 

Moses,
however, does not stand aside, but pleads for mercy, literally standing between
the wrath of God and the sinful people. "Turn from your burning anger and
relent from this disaster against your people," he pleads. "Remember Abraham,
Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said
to them, 'I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven, and all this
land that I have promised I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit
it forever.'" Moses doesn't argue that the people don't deserve to be destroyed---they
certainly do, because they have rebelled against the king of the universe.

Rather, Moses appeals to God's promise, to
God's own trustworthiness, and says, "God, you swore by yourself that you would
fulfill this promise."

And
here's the shocking thing: God relents. He is pleased with how Moses has
interceded for the people. Though the people had broken the terms of the
covenant and thus justly deserved wrath to fall on them, because of Moses'
plea, God's wrath turns away. The God of heaven and earth listens to a man, and
revokes the decree of destruction.

That
should surprise us as we approach the climax of the Old Testament in Exodus
33-34\. What is the meaning of this? Why would God listen to a man? Why would he
threaten destruction, and then change his mind? Are the skeptics right? Is God
really a capricious bully with a hair-trigger temper? Or is there something
else going on here?

That's
the question that Exodus 33-34 answers for us. Moses, perhaps emboldened by his
successful intercession, goes all in for his next request in 33:18:

__

_Moses said, "Please
show me your glory."_

God's
glory is the display of his manifold perfections, the declaration of his
infinite worth, to be seen and admired and valued. So when Moses asks to see
God's glory, what he's asking is, "Please, God, show me the heart of who you
really are---your greatness, your beauty, your worth."

This, by
the way, is a prayer that God loves to answer. He loves to reveal his infinite
worth and beauty to his creatures to be admired and praised and enjoyed. This
is why the universe was created (Psalm 19:1). It's why he rescued his people
from Egypt (Exodus 14:17-18). It's why he sent his Son to rescue you (Ephesians
1:6). It's the aim I'm praying for in this book. Everything God does, he does
for the display of his glory, to be seen and admired and enjoyed. That's why
it's not an exaggeration to say that this moment on the mountain with Moses is
the heart of the Old Testament. This is, literally, what the whole book is
about.

So how
does God respond to this request? Let's keep reading:

__

_Moses said, "Please
show me your glory." And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you
and will proclaim before you my name, 'Yahweh.' And I will be gracious to whom
I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."_

Moses
asks for a sight of God's glory, and God's response is three-fold. First, he
says, "I will show you my goodness."

"Goodness"
in the Bible is a commitment to value what is most valuable---namely, God's glory
(read the chapter on goodness in 

_Cross
Connections_

for more on that). And so when God says, "I will make all my
goodness pass before you," what he's saying is, "You want to see what I'm all
about? Then look at how much I value my own glory."

The
second thing God says is, "I will proclaim before you my name, 'Yahweh.'"
Yahweh is God's covenant name, revealed to Moses at the burning bush, and
means, "I am who I am." God's name means that he is self-existent and
independent. He is who he is, completely apart from you or anyone. He's not
dependent on anyone and needs nothing from anyone. When everything crumbles, he
remains unshaken. He is unconstrained by anything outside of his own heart and
will, and free to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. He existed before
the universe was, and long after this world has turned to dust, he will still
be here. He is Final, Absolute Reality with which we must all reckon.

The third
thing that God says connects God's free, unconstrained character ("I am who I
am") to how he deals with us: "I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,
and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy." In other words, "I am unconstrained
Goodness, and I am free to bestow that goodness, mercy, and grace however I
want." God is not obligated to give mercy, especially not to ungrateful rebels
like us. And if he shows kindness to one person, he is not required to show
kindness to another. God is not an egalitarian---he is not constrained to treat
everyone with equal measures of mercy. The universe is not a democracy. If one
person receives grace and you don't, he has done you no wrong. This rubs all
our notions of human fairness the wrong way, but this is practically the
definition of what it means that he is God: he is free. He is who he is, and he
shows mercy to whomever he wants to show mercy.

That's a
strange answer to Moses' request, isn't it? "Show me your glory, Lord!" Moses
asks. And God's response is: "I value my glory above all else, and I am utterly
free and independent in all my actions, including all my benevolent actions
towards you." But the reason that God responds this way is that his
self-existence and freedom 

_is_

his
glory. He is glorious, wonderful, and valuable precisely 

_because_

he is the unconstrained I AM.

Now at
this point, I need to reveal something: we're not actually at the climax.
Everything in the last several pages has just been building towards the climax.
It's been necessary to see it all, so that we'll understand what we're seeing
when we arrive at highest point of the story. Even what God said to Moses in
Exodus 33:19 is not the climax; it's more like the preview of the climax, the
"coming soon" advertisement of the main attraction. The climax comes next, in
Exodus 34:6-7, as God fully answers Moses' request by doing what he said he
would do: passing before him and proclaiming his name and glory. What God says
in these two verses is the blazing heart of the Old Testament (and, as we'll
see soon, the entire Bible).

__

_The LORD passed
before him and proclaimed, "Yahweh, Yahweh, a God merciful and gracious, slow
to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast
love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will
by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the
children and the children's children, to the third and fourth generation." And
Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped._

These two
verses are, literally, the entire Bible in miniature. They put the holy heart
of God on full display, and even show the correct response to God's
self-revelation (Moses falling on his face in fearful worship). The rest of the
Bible is the unpacking of these two verses. There is a lifetime of glory to behold
here, but I want us to see three things in particular that will guide our study
of the fear of God: God's heart for sinners, God's hatred of sin, and the holy
paradox which that creates right at the heart of the Bible.

GOD'S
HEART FOR SINNERS

What God
says first about his character decisively answers our question of whether or
not God is an unstable, hot-tempered bully. Coming in the aftermath of Israel's
grievous rebellion, this is the first thing God has to say about himself: "A
God 

_merciful_

and 

_gracious_

, 

_slow_

to anger, 

_abounding_

in steadfast love and
faithfulness." God's actions towards us are defined first and foremost by mercy
and grace. This is his primary disposition towards sinful creatures, even
towards rebels like Israel (and like us) who jettison the Creator in favor of
his creation. He is not capricious or quick-tempered; rather, he is slow to
anger. 2 Peter 3:9 says it this way: "The Lord is patient toward you, not
wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance." If and
when God's wrath does finally fall on sin, it's not because he loves punishing
people. God doesn't delight in punishment; he delights in patience towards
sinners, pardon towards rebels, and mercy towards the unworthy. "Have I any
pleasure in the death of the wicked?" God asks in Ezekiel 18\. "I have no
pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Lord GOD; so turn and live."
God's undeserved patience and persistent offer of repentance and mercy is
grounded in his delight to forgive. He is abounding in, abundant with,
overflowing in steadfast, relentless love and faithfulness to his promises.

Out of
that heart overflows God's actions toward sinners: "keeping steadfast love for
thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sins." His steadfast,
relentless love pursues thousands and millions with kindness. "Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life," (Psalm 23:6) because he
keeps steadfast love for thousands. The holy Judge of the all the earth
forgives transgression; the King of the universe lets rebels go free.

GOD'S
HATRED OF SIN

But lest
you think that this Judge and King is a softy and a pushover, keep reading for
one of the most jarring shifts halfway through a sentence in the entire Bible.
"...forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, 

_but who will by no means clear the guilty_

, visiting the iniquity of
the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and
fourth generation." This God who, on one hand, delights in patience and mercy
and forgiveness, on the other hand is ferociously intolerant of sin. This is
not a judge who winks at crime. He will not clear the guilty or sweep sin under
the rug of the universe or let bygones be bygones. In fact, he decrees that the
devastating effects of sin be felt across generations with temporal and eternal
consequences. 

A mere
two chapters before this, in Exodus 32:33, God gives no room for negotiation:
"Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot out of my book." To be blotted out
of the book of life, Revelation 14 says, will have horrific eternal
consequences:

__

_\[The one whose name
is not written in the book of life\] will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured
full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and
sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of of the Lamb. And
the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day
or night._

This
vivid description of the horror of everlasting judgment should make us tremble.
The full strength of omnipotent wrath is not something to be joked about or taken
lightly. Truly, the reality of hell and endless conscious torment as the just
penalty for sin should strike our hearts with holy fear. You and I are sinners;
we deserve to be blotted out of the book of life and for those words in
Revelation 14 to be our destiny.

A HOLY
PARADOX

Do you
notice, in all this, a seeming contradiction?

How can I spend two paragraphs describing God's relentless, merciful
love, and then another two paragraphs describing the horror of hell and God's judgment,
and still be talking about the same person? Look at God's words in Exodus 34:7
again: "forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, 

_but who will by no means clear the guilty._

" How can you forgive sin
but by no means clear the guilty? That seems like a contradiction! Which is it,
God, forgiveness or punishment? How can you forgive sinners while not letting
the guilty go free?

This is
the holy paradox at the heart of this passage. In Exodus 34:7 you have unconstrained
Reality shining at its brightest, and it turns out that there is a paradox at
the heart of Reality itself. This paradox is the engine powering the entire storyline
of the Bible. From Adam and Eve's rebellion, with God threatening "In the day
you eat of it you will surely die" and then promising a rescuer; to this interaction
at Mount Sinai between a holy God and a sinful people; to an elaborate
sacrificial system where lambs die instead of sinners; to the climax of all
climaxes, the arrival of God's Son---every story is the unfolding of this paradox:
how can a holy God of love forgive sin and punish sin at the same time? 

Through
the rest of the Old Testament, we're not given a clear answer to that question,
although we are given pointers. God's people are given a sacrificial system and
a Day of Atonement by which sinful people like them can live in covenant
fellowship with a holy God. Their sins are placed on an animal and the animal
is slaughtered, a vivid and violent depiction of the truth that God will by no
means clear the guilty. But with the animal slain for their sin, God's
forgiveness is then announced to them, a precious reminder of the truth that
God is merciful and gracious. As the story continues, prophets intermingle
pronouncements judgment and mercy, often juxtaposed right on top of one
another. But as the story progresses, one thing gets clearer: these are only
temporary solutions to the paradox. The blood of bulls and lambs can't fully
atone for the guilt of sin against an infinitely worthy God. Prophets see
through a mirror dimly, pointing to a future where the paradox is finally
resolved.

And as
the storyline of the Bible unfolds, the paradox does get resolved, but in the
most unexpected way possible: the paradox, it turns out, is a Person.

WRATH AND
LOVE: GOD AT CALVARY

In the
New Testament, the paradox bursts onto the scene in the person of God's Son,
Jesus Christ. Here is the Holy One himself, hanging out with sinners. The
Eternal I Am, born as a baby. The Mighty King of the universe, coming in
meekness and humility. The almighty Word of God, entering the world as a
whisper. The Author of life, submitting to the ignominy and horror of death on
a cross. If the central moment of the Old Testament was the unveiling of the
paradox, "forgiving sin and by no means clearing the guilty" at Sinai, the
central moment of the New Testament is the unveiling of the solution to that
paradox at Calvary. At the cross, the paradox at the heart of reality is put on
full display as the holy God of love rescues sinners by pouring out his wrath
against sin on his perfect Son.

There are
many New Testament texts that make this clear, but 1 John 4:8-10 in particular
connects the merciful love of God and holy wrath of God in a profound way:

__

_God is love. In this
the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the
world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have
loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
sins._

God is
love, John says. That's probably one of the most famous sentences in the Bible,
but most people don't realize what he says next. What John does next is to
define what he means by that statement, "God is love." And what he says is an
unpacking of the paradox in Exodus 34:7\.

"In this
is love," John says. "Not that we have loved God"---because, of course, we do a
terrible job at loving God. Jesus said that God's requirement for us could be
summed up in the simple command, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart
and all your mind and all your soul and all your strength." I don't know about
you, but I don't think there has been one moment of my life when I've 

_ever_

done that; I have never one loved
God with every thought in my head and emotion in my heart and fiber of my
being. Never, not once. That means that every moment of my life, I'm failing to
live up to even the most basic summary of what God requires of me. My best
moments are enough to condemn me for my lack of love for God. Truly, I am in
desperate need of a Savior.

That's
why what John says next is such good news: "In this is love, not that we have
loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our
sins." "Propitiation" is a big Bible word, but it's probably the most important
word you could ever add to your vocabulary. It means "a sacrifice that turns
away wrath and absorbs it." In the Old Testament, it was the word used to
describe the sacrifice on the Day of Atonement (or, literally in the Hebrew,
"Day of Propitiation"), when the sins of the people would be symbolically
placed on the head of an animal that was then slain for those sins. The
punishment for sins would fall on the animal who absorbed it and died in their
place.

That's
what John says that Jesus came to do for us. "He sent his Son to be a propitiation---the
sacrifice that turns away wrath for our sins and absorbs it." Jesus is the Lamb
of God who steps into our place, shoulders the weight and guilt of our sins,
and then receives the full punishment and fury of God's wrath directed at that
sin. Like the animal on the day of atonement, the punishment for my sins falls
on Jesus, who absorbs it and dies in my place. Isaiah 53, one of the Old
Testament prophecies pointing to the paradox, says it this way:

__

_He was pierced for
our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the
punishment that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. All we
like sheep have gone astray; we have turned---every one---to his own way; and the
LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. ~Isaiah 53:5-7_

I want
you to realize something crucial: this, John says, is the very definition of
love. This is what it means that "God is love." 1 John 4 says, in other words,
"God is love; his essence and heart and character is love itself. And 

_this_

is what that love looks like: he
sends his Son to be slaughtered under his wrath instead of you." The crushing
weight of our iniquity is laid on Jesus, the punishment for our sins wounding
him instead of us. This is the definition of love.

Do you
see how the cross is the embodiment of the paradox in Exodus 34:7? "Yahweh, a
God merciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but
who will by no means clear the guilty." At the cross, Yahweh forgives iniquity
and transgression and sin, not by simply letting it go or sweeping it under the
rug, but by punishing his Son and holding him accountable as the guilty one in
our place. At the cross, the divine heart is fully expressed; love for sinners
and hatred for sin come together as God forgives sinners by punishing their sin
in the person of his Son.

This interplay
between wrath and love means something very profound for our understanding of both
the love of God and fear of God. God's love for us is not sentimental or
wishy-washy. He is not a tame lion. He's not a pushover grandfather in the sky
who likes to spoil his grandkids. He's not a jolly and gentle Santa Claus, who
sees when you're sleeping, knows when you're awake, knows when you've been bad
and good... but in the end, gives presents to just about everybody. Rather, his
love is a holy, terrifying thing. God's love, Scripture tells us, is expressed
most clearly in the violence of crushing his Son under the weight of his wrath.
This is not a love to be trifled with, taken for granted, or lightly dismissed.

HOLY
TERROR IN THE GARDEN

Probably
one of the best ways to understand the full force of what this kind of love
means is to follow Jesus as he prepares to undergo the horror of the cross.
Follow him into the garden of Gethsemane the night before the crucifixion to
see love at its greatest possible extent, and you will be surprised at what you
see.

What
you'll see is Jesus---who for his entire ministry was always perfectly in
control, acting and speaking with the calmness of a sovereign to whom nature
itself bows---seemingly out of control. The scene is actually shocking when you
think about it. The One who stopped storms and raised corpses with a word, who time
and again proved his authority over all the forces of hell and whose mere
presence made demons tremble, is weeping on the ground. For his entire life, he
has been the calm eye at the center of a hurricane; chaos sweeps around him,
violence and opposition rises, demons and authorities rage, but he remains untouched.
But now it is as if the hurricane is closing in on him, and for the first time
we see Jesus afraid. And not just afraid; what we witness in the garden is
Jesus in the throes of uncontrolled terror and grief. Matthew records these
words to the disciples:

__

_"My soul is very sorrowful,
even to the point of death." ~Matthew 26:38_

Really,
Jesus? Sorrowful to the point of death? We might think Jesus is guilty of a
little hyperbole here, until Luke 22:44 gives us this startling picture of the
Savior:

__

_And being in great
agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood
falling to the ground._

What
could possibly cause the sovereign Calm One, the self-existent I Am of Exodus
34, to possibly behave like this? The one who healed the blind and lame, who fed
thousands with the power of his creative word, is in "great agony," to the
point of death, sweat dripping off his trembling face like drops of blood. What
has happened?

The
answer lies in what he is praying. Let's listen in: 

__

_"My Father, if it be
possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you
will... My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done."
~Matthew 26:39,42_

When
Jesus prays that this "cup" pass from him, he's not just talking about the suffering
of the impending cross. Many martyrs have bravely faced a death just as
horrific as Jesus without going to pieces. Soldiers on the battlefield have heroically
given their lives for their brothers-at-arms without a second thought, let
alone without weeping and fear. From everything we've seen of Jesus, we would
not expect him to show less courage than others in the face of suffering.
Something else must be going on here.

And
truly, something fearful is happening. You see, "the cup" that Jesus refers to
is a common biblical expression for the wrath of God. Psalm 75:8 describes it
this way: 

__

_"In the hand of Yahweh
there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all
the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs."_

In Isaiah
51 God's wrath is pictured:

__

_"Stand up, O
Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath, who
have drunk to the dregs the bowl, the cup of staggering."_

And then
there is Revelation 14, which we looked at earlier: 

__

_"\[the wicked\] will
drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger,
and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur."_

Mere
hours from the cross, Jesus contemplates the full-orbed horror of what awaits
him: draining the cup of God's fury at sin down to the dregs, absorbing in his
own body the poisonous "cup of staggering," the "full strength" cup of God's
anger. No wonder, as Jesus thinks on this, that he staggers to the ground and
pleads, "Is there any way to avoid this?" Jesus, who has existed forever
sharing the Father's glory, who revealed himself at Sinai as the one who
forgives sin but who will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, knows the
full extent of what this cup means. It means the horror of hell, the anguish of
separation from the Father, and the torment of everlasting punishment,
distilled down to a concentrated six hours of bloody, screaming agony on the
cross. And he is terrified.

Stop and
consider that for a moment. Jesus, the incarnate God, is terrified of the
Father's wrath. If 

_God himself_

is
afraid of something, how utterly horrific must that thing be? As you see Jesus
sweating blood and weeping, learn the true horror of hell. Because what Jesus
is doing here in the garden is preparing to drink hell... for you. He is
preparing to stand in the place of the wicked and drink the wine of God's
wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger. The Father, in upholding
the worth of his glory and vindicating his justice, will not let one drop of
his anger against the guilty go unspent, and Jesus knows that the full weight
of that guilt is about to be laid on him. "The Lord has laid on him the
iniquity of us all."

But in
the same moment where you see the holy horror of God's wrath, we also see the
terrifying tenderness of his love. Listen to Jesus' words again: "My Father, if
this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done." What he means is, "If
this cannot pass 

_from them_

---if there
is no other way for the punishment to pass over them unless the Passover Lamb's
blood is shed, if there is no other way to forgive sin and clear the guilty unless
I drink it---then I will do it for them." In that moment, we see Jesus resolving
to do the unthinkable and bear the unbearable: he will drink the cup for you.

In this
is love, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to
do this... to stand in our place, the innocent for the guilty, and drink the cup
that was meant for us. He sent his Son to be the propitiation, the
wrath-bearer, the cup-drinker, the slaughtered Lamb, who forgives sin and by no
means clears the guilty. What Moses longed to see---"show me your glory!"---is here
on full display, as God's goodness passes before us in the garden and on the cross.
What we see here is the utmost height of love, the farthest possible extent of
kindness, as the Holy One embraces the horror of hell to rescue the
least-deserving: you.

Let's
return for a moment to the original premise of this chapter: to understand what
fearing God means, we need to understand his character and heart. Here we have
God's heart on full display as he kneels in the garden, about to be broken for
your healing, punished to bring you peace, taste death to secure your life,
drink hell to purchase heaven for you. The greatest realities in the
universe---the wrath of God and the love of God---collide at the cross in a holy
paradox to teach us what fearing God means. The rest of this book will start to
put feet on that paradox as we look more closely at the cross and how it
teaches us to fear God, and at Jesus, the Paradox himself, who is both Lion and
Lamb, majestic and meek, holy and humble.

**CHAPTER 2- KNOWING THAT YOU WERE
RANSOMED**

**__**

**_Conduct yourselves with
fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were ransomed... ~1
Peter 1:17-18_**

The
greatest realities in the universe are wrapped up in the paradox of God's wrath
and love. Reading through the Old Testament, you can almost feel the urgent leaning
forward, pressing in farther and farther to the paradox, looking for the answer
but never quite arriving. The prophet Habakkuk complains about the mingling of
divine justice and mercy, until he throws up his hands in worshipful surrender,
saying, "Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh; I will take joy in the God of my
salvation" (Habakkuk 3:18). Afflicted and beaten down, Job longed for a
mediator between a holy God and sinful man who could reconcile the realities of
divine punishment and divine clemency. But when God finally addresses him, Job's
trembling response was humbled repentance: "I have uttered what I did not
understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know... therefore I
despise myself and repent in dust and ashes" (Job 42:3,6). The Psalms tremble
with brokenness and beauty, an agonized wrestling with a just and loving God: "I
say to God, my rock, 'Why have you forgotten me?... Why are you cast down, O my
soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again
praise him, my salvation and my God'" (Psalm 42:9,11). The last prophet of the
Old Testament, Malachi, gives the final word on fearing God, a simultaneous
promise of hope and horror: "The day is coming, burning like an oven, when all
the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble. The day that is coming shall
set them ablaze, says the LORD of hosts, so that it will leave them neither
root nor branch. But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall
rise with healing in its wings" (Malachi 4:1-2). In fact, the last sentence of
the Old Testament is a promise of the coming messiah and the restoration of
God's people. But the last word in that sentence, the final word of the Old
Testament? "Destruction." And so the curtain falls on the Old Testament with the
paradox unresolved.

GOOD NEWS
OR OLD NEWS?

With the
fullness of the new covenant and the resolution of the paradox in Jesus' death
and resurrection at last unveiled, the apostle Peter stands amazed, and invites
us to participate in his amazement. Trace carefully what Peter says about the
resolution of the paradox:

__

_Concerning this
salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours
searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of
Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and
the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that they were serving not
themselves but you, in the things that have been announced to you through those
who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things
into which angels long to look. ~1 Peter 1:10-12_

All those
prophets---Habakkuk, Job, David, Malachi, and others---saw the grace that has now
been given to you, and longed to experience and understand what you enjoy. You
enjoy access into the mind and heart of God unparalleled in all of redemptive
history, because you are the recipient of the unveiling of the greatest
realities in the universe. The "sufferings of Christ and the subsequent
glories" are the answer to every unanswered question of the Old Testament. All
of those prophecies, Peter said, were ultimately not for their benefit, but for
yours, that you might more fully know and rejoice in the paradox of God. They
saw the shadows dimly from a distance; you get to sit back and enjoy the
substance.

But it
gets even better than that. Did you see the last phrase of Peter's? All this
glory, all this grace, all this good news, are "things into which angels long
to look." All the angelic hosts of heaven are utterly baffled by this mystery.
They themselves stand in awe of the God of wrath and love, and even though they
have heavenly, front-row seats to the paradox, they long to understand and
experience what you enjoy.

That's a
truly tremendous thing to say; I can't think of a bigger way to state the
massive significance of Jesus' death and resurrection than to say, "Even angels
long to look into these things." 

The
intermingling of judgment and mercy, the sacrificial death of God's Son, and
the everlasting rescue of rebels, are utterly baffling to the heavenly host. 

But it
does beg a question: to what extent are you enjoying the grace that prophets searched
for and angels long to understand? Are you amazed by the grace that you have
received, or have the most breathtaking realities in the universe become
routine to you? Has the good news become old news?

If it
has, don't despair. Peter continues, laying a foundation for a life motivated
by amazing grace, captivated by the fear of God at the foot of the cross. Read
on:

__

_Therefore, preparing
your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace
that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient
children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as
he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is
written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy." And if you call on him
as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct
yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were
ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with
perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of
Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. ~1 Peter 1:13-19_

I love
the phrase, "Set your hope 

_fully_

on
the grace that will be brought to you." Believer, anchor your security in one
thing and one thing only: the amazing grace that saved a wretch like you. The
unveiled paradox of wrath and love is the foundation of all hope and
confidence. Don't trust your works, your faith, your repentance, or any other
host of good things; Jesus, and Jesus alone, is the only source of salvation
and security.

And yet,
if you truly understand that, if you are amazed by the grace that amazes
angels, if your hope is fully set on free grace, the result will not be a lazy
life of wishy-washy commitment. No, your life will look like "obedient
children." Amazing grace is transforming grace. Grace that does not amaze will
not transform, and if you're not being transformed by it, it's because you're
not amazed. Amazement lies at the heart of all Christian transformation. The
paradox at the blazing heart of God, when it captures 

_your_

heart, will start to work its way out in your life by making
you look more and more like the paradox you love. "As he who called you is
holy"---that is, utterly unique, set apart, and radically committed to justice
and mercy---"you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You
shall be holy, for I am holy.'" Let your life be like a lens refracting the
beauty of the paradox into this darkened world, so that people can see the holy
love of God worked out through your own love of sinful people.

As we
keep reading, we see how Peter makes clear that the life he is describing is no
less than what it means to fear God. "If you call on him as Father who
judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear
throughout the time of your exile." The reality that our heavenly Father
is a holy and impartial judge, Peter said, should fill us with an appropriate
holy fear of displeasing him. He is a gracious, lavish, blessing, pursuing
Father... but he is also a holy, wrathful, sin-hating Father. These twin
realities are the paradox that has saved us, and we must never lose sight of
both sides of our Father's heart. If we lose sight of his kindness, we will
only view him with a slavish fear-- and that's not the kind of fear Peter is
talking about here. But conversely, if we lose sight of his ferocious holiness,
we will forget that our Father has high standards for his children and will
miss the whole meaning of the Lord's prayer: "Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name." That means, let your name be seen as holy, held in
reverence... starting with me and everyone who sees me.

KNOWING
YOU WERE RANSOMED

Those two
aspects of the paradox-- our Father's holiness and his great love for us-- are always
in tension in the Christian life as we fight for clearer views of his grace and
continue to struggle with indwelling sin. That's why Peter says that we are to
conduct ourselves with fear in a certain, specific kind of way. He says to
conduct yourselves with fear... knowing something. "Conduct yourselves
with fear throughout the time of your exile, 

_knowing that you were ransomed_

." 

This
sentence is the clearest place in the Bible where the fear of God and the grace
of God are brought together. In fact, it was this sentence that prompted me to
write this whole book. "Conduct yourself with fear, knowing that you were
ransomed." This is, in the words of John Newton, "grace that taught my heart to
fear." In the ransom that God paid for us at the cross, we see the paradox of God's
holiness and love brought together. Any kind of fear that lacks this knowledge
of redemption will ultimately prove destructive. But fear of God that says,
"Father, you are holy... and you have redeemed me," is the kind of
fear that Proverbs 14:27 talks about: "The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of
life." This is the kind of fear that the paradox of God creates, on which
the entire Christian life is based. This is not slavish fear of punishment;
this is the fear of a child who knows his father's love and delight and
therefore eagerly wants to please him. Only a knowledge of gospel redemption
can create this kind of fear in our hearts.

So how
exactly does this work? How does the gospel operate to create this kind of fear
in our hearts and in our lives? The gospel fear that we need to cultivate, the
kind of gospel fear that will lead to a joyful pursuit of holiness and reverent
fear, knows that we have been ransomed. Therefore it follows that the more we
know and understand about this ransom, the greater our gospel fear will be. And
so Peter continues: "You were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from
your forefathers..." This means that we have been purchased out of a
slavery far more destructive than the Israelite's slavery in Egypt; we have
been purchased out of an inherited slavery to sin. This is a greater sight of
glory than Moses ever glimpsed on Mount Sinai when the paradox was first
revealed; in the gospel we have been ushered through a greater Exodus out of
greater slavery into greater freedom and greater glory.

PRECIOUS
BLOOD

What was
the cost of this purchase? Peter continues: "You were ransomed from the
futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as
silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without
blemish or spot." No mere gold or silver or any other perishable thing
could pay for the great cost of our sin; for a rescue on this scale, a passover
lamb will not suffice. Nothing we could offer to God could come close to the
price necessary. Psalm 49 lays out this problem and solution in a beautiful,
gospel-foretelling way:

__

_Truly no man can
ransom another, or give to God the price of his life, for the ransom of their
life is costly and can never suffice, that he should live forever and never see
the pit... But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will
receive me. ~Psalm 49:7-9,15_

It is
impossible to ransom yourself, or to ransom anyone else, because "the
ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice." The nature of sin--
infinite crime against an infinite God-- means that no human ransom could ever
suffice. The price is impossibly high. The value of your life is simply not
enough to pay the ransom. And also note who demands the ransom: not the devil,
nor any person, but God himself. "Truly no man can give

_to God_

the price of his life."
Here we see the paradox again: God, who is the One we have offended and sinned
against, demands payment for sin and will by no means leave the guilty
unpunished. The ransom must be paid.

But God
(oh how precious are those gospel words!), but God will ransom my soul, the
psalmist declares. Only God can pay to God what God requires, and so the
impossibly high price is paid by God himself. The psalmist doesn't elaborate on
how this could be done, but standing on the other side of the cross, we know
the full reality that Psalm 49 points to: only the precious blood of Christ,
the God-man, could pay the impossibly high price of the ransom.

It would
do us well to linger longer here, on the words "the precious blood of
Christ," and let the full weight of these words sink further into our
souls, so that they will have the effect that Peter intended: a holy gospel
fear.

To feel
the full weight of these words, consider why the price had to be paid. Sin is
an infinite crime against an infinite God that deserves an infinite punishment.
One moment of less-than-perfect love, misplaced trust, or ugly pride is enough
to justly condemn you to an eternity of punishment in hell. And you and I stand
guilty of literally millions of those moments. Jesus said that the most basic
summary of God's law was "love the Lord your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:37). I don't think
I have ever done that, even once; I have never once loved God with every
emotion in my heart and every fiber of my being and every thought in my head.
Never once. And neither have you. That means that each and every moment of your
entire life fails to live up to even the most basic summary of God's requirement.
Every moment of my life, by itself, merits an eternity of punishment. How many
eternities of punishment have you and I earned by our costly disobedience?
Countless millions. Truly, no one can give to God the cost of his life, for the
ransom is costly and can never suffice. If left to pay it ourselves, endless
ages of eternal punishment will never exhaust our guilt.

Stand in
wonder, then, that the Son of God, in one act of sacrificing himself in your
place, paid the entirety of your debt... and the debt of every person who would
ever trust him!

Six hours on the cross
exhausted the infinite debt of countless millions, each of whom owed countless
millions of eternities of punishment. And all of that guilt was paid for by one
man, on one day, in one final sacrifice.

How
valuable, then, must the Son of God be, to be sufficient to pay the full ransom
for all God's people by himself! "The precious blood of Christ"
hardly begins to describe the great worth of Jesus Christ. He is infinitely
glorious, infinitely worthy of everlasting praise. He is the most valuable
Reality in the universe, the very definition of beauty and splendor, the King
of all creation, the Self-Existent I AM, the One by whom and for whom
everything exists. So, when he steps forward to offer the price of his life,
the sheer value of his divine person means that his sacrifice pays for all the
sins of all who trust him across all of history, and purchases them for himself
for all eternity.

Oh, how
the great worth of Jesus should move us to worship and fear! We were made to
behold his beauty, to be satisfied by his steadfast love, to delight in his
glory, to revel in his worth. And nowhere is his beauty, steadfast love, glory,
and worth more clearly displayed for the everlasting enjoyment of his people
than at the cross, where he made us his forever.

In the light of his great glory and worth,
the call to holiness and fear is simply a call to embrace what is most
beautiful, most satisfying, most thrilling-- Jesus himself.

That's
why Proverbs can say strange things like, "The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of
life." Here is the endless fountain of amazing grace, the living water flowing
from our Savior's wounds that satisfies the soul and transforms our lives. The
heart of gospel fear is seeing and feeling the infinite worth of Jesus as he
bleeds for our sins. Gospel fear trembles to think that each act of
disobedience cost the Son of God his life, trembles to realize that such a high
price would be paid for an unworthy one such as I, and trembles with joy to see
every crime against heaven absolved and paid for and buried in an ocean of
precious, atoning blood. Is it any wonder that for centuries saints have sung
with John Newton,

__

_'Twas grace that
taught my heart to fear_

__

_And grace my fears
relieved_

__

_How precious did
that grace appear_

__

_The hour I first
believed!_

May the
Holy Spirit so open your eyes to the preciousness of paradoxical grace that its
value in your eyes would only increase, day by day and into eternity, where we
will join around the throne to praise, singing, "Worthy is the Lamb who was
slain!"

****

**CHAPTER 3- OF COURSE HE ISN'T SAFE**

**__**

**_I am God and not a
man, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath. They shall go
after Yahweh; he will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children will come
trembling from the west. ~Hosea 11:9-10_**

As I have
reflected on the paradox of God, the blazing center of reality, I have been
struck by two truths that stand at the heart of what it means to fear God: God
is the only source of true safety, and God is the ultimate source of danger. He
is a forgiving and merciful Judge who will by no means clear the guilty. Our
only hope of ultimate, everlasting safety is that he would be merciful and
forgiving towards sinners like us. But as sinners, facing the just, well-earned
wrath of God is the ultimate danger, the only real peril of our existence. Gospel
fear exists in the paradox where these two realities collide, at the foot of
the cross where we see our sin punished in the body of our Substitute, the
Innocent exchanged for the guilty so that those guilty ones can go free.

Contemplating
this paradox of dangerous security, I'm reminded of the scene in C.S. Lewis's 

_The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe _

when
the children have just learned about Aslan, who represents Jesus in the
Chronicles of Narnia:

__

_"Aslan is a lion---the Lion, the
great Lion."_

__

_"Ooh," said Susan. "I thought he
was a man. Is he---quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion."_

__

_"Safe?" said Mr. Beaver. "Who said
anything about safe? Of course he isn't safe. But he's good. He's the King, I
tell you."_

What C.S.
Lewis so keenly understood is the truth about God that we often forget: he
isn't safe. We've got to right-size our view of our King; he is the Lion of
Judah, the King of all creation, the hurricane God who holds our life and
breath. He is not a man; he is not like us. He is infinite in power,
unparalleled in wisdom, ferocious in holiness, passionate in love, furious in
wrath. Of course he isn't safe.

If you've
ever heard a lion roar, you know what I'm talking about. It's unlike anything
you've ever experienced. Once I was at a zoo when it happened. We weren't
anywhere near the lion exhibit---it was over on the other side of the zoo. But we
could hear the roar from where we stood, half a mile away, over all the bustle
and hubbub around us. So I can imagine standing face to face with a lion on the
African savannah somewhere, with no fence between us. In that situation, a
roaring lion would be the most deafening, terrifying experience I could
imagine. Lions are not safe.

But
here's the beauty of it all: God isn't safe, but he is good. He is both the
rock of stumbling and the rock of refuge . He is holy and loving, just and
merciful, terrible and tender, lion and lamb, unsafe and all-consumingly good. In
Ethiopia---a country where they have actual experience with real, wild lions---their
word for "lion" carries special meaning. The word "anbesa" ("lion") is actually
used colloquially to refer to something awesome or cool. If your friend does a
backflip, you'd say, "Anbesa!" If you see a beautiful sunset, you might
exclaim, "Anbesa!" In Ethiopia, a lion symbolizes everything good: majesty,
power, beauty, and strength. Is it any wonder, then, that throughout the Bible,
God is referred to as a lion? He in't safe, but he is the sum of everything
that is good.

THE
BROKEN HEART OF GOD

Once of
my favorite descriptions of God as a lion comes in the book of Hosea. Hosea
describes this scene of God summoning his wayward people back to himself:

__

_They shall go after
Yahweh; he will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come
trembling from the west. ~Hosea 11:10_

To
capture the full weight of that scene, and to really grasp what it means that
God is a roaring lion, we actually need to back up a little bit, because the context
is key to grasping all that this text means. The first ten chapters of Hosea
vividly describe the faithless idolatry of Israel as a bride who has cheated on
her husband. In this picture, we are the faithless bride, and God is the
wronged husband. Throughout the prophecy, God's people are called
"whores"---strong language for the heinous act of betraying their heavenly Lover.
Here are some of the highlights of the indictment:

__

_"She went after her
lovers and forgot me, declares Yahweh." ~2:13_

__

_"They have left
their God to play the whore." ~4:12_

__

_"Their deeds do not
permit them to return to their God. For the spirit of whoredom is within them,
and they do not know Yahweh." ~5:4_

__

_"Woe to them, for
they have strayed from me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against
me!" ~7:13_

__

_"You have played the
whore, forsaking your God." ~9:1_

Stop for
a moment and realize that the graphic language used to describe Israel's
idolatry is what God thinks of 

_your_

sin, too. This isn't just hyperbole; what sin is, at its core, is spiritual
adultery, a betrayal of the Lover of our souls. It's us saying to God, "You're
not enough for me; I don't love you enough to be interested in respecting you,
and so I will go find satisfaction elsewhere." Imagine saying that to your
spouse. And yet we blithely say this hundreds of times a day by the way we
treat God.

This, by
the way, is why God's wrath is just and deserved. We have spurned his kindness,
ignored his love, cheated on his covenant, abused his faithfulness, and used
his blessings to fuel our lustful passions. As a heavenly Husband who has been
cuckolded and taken advantage of, divorce would be a fair option.

And yet,
throughout Hosea, intermingled with the indictment of spiritual adultery, are
promises that our heavenly Husband will not abandon us to the consequences of
our whoredom:

__

_"But I will have
mercy on the house of Judah, and I will save them by Yahweh their God." ~1:7_

__

_"I will betroth you
to me forever. I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in
steadfast love and mercy." ~2:19_

__

_"I will heal their
apostasy; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them." ~14:4_

God's
response to our spiritual adultery is not merely anger; he also overflows with brokenhearted
love. Chapter 11 is the high point of this interwoven justice and mercy. Listen
to the grieving heart of our God, who loves us and longs for us:

__

_When Israel was a
child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. The more they were
called, the more they went away... Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk; I
took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them. I led
them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as
one who eases their yoke; I bent down to them and fed them. ~11:1-4_

Do you
hear the sadness in God's voice? Sadness! God is not an impersonal force; he is
a passionate lover who delights in his people. He is angered and grieved by our
betrayal. Can't you hear it in his voice? "The more I called them, the more
they went away... I took them up by their arms, but they didn't know that I was
the one who healed them."

How often
have I been like this, ignoring the alluring voice of my Lover and Friend, and
choosing the destruction of sin over the sweetness of his fellowship? How often
have I taken blessings and healing from his hand and loved the gifts while
ignoring the Giver? Every day of my life, I have been led with cords of
kindness... and more often than not, I have chafed and fought against the
restraints. I deserve to be abandoned for my ingratitude, and yet he still
bends down to me day by day with sustaining grace.

I linger
here because I'm afraid of my own tendency to analyze God, put him in a box,
and describe his glory and beauty with clever, alliterative adjectives like
"terrible and tender," and conclude that I know God. And if you're the kind of
person who reads books like this, you're probably like that too. And yet Hosea
11 confronts us with a picture of a God who won't submit to clinical
inspections or critical analysis, because he's a real, living Person with
emotions like grief and love and anger. True, he's God and not a man... but that doesn't
mean he doesn't think and feel; it only means that his heart and mind and emotions
are so much bigger, so much brighter than ours. It doesn't make insulting and
abandoning him less hurtful or treacherous, but more so. Hosea frames our sin
not primarily in terms of rebellion but of relationship so that we will feel
the emotional weight of our spiritual adultery and just how much our sin wounds
the God who loves us.

Seeing
the broken heart of God on full display here puts sin and mercy into a whole
different light. Listen in as God's broken heart bursts out in redemptive
resolve:

__

_My heart recoils
within me; my compassion grows warm and tender. I will not execute my burning
anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not a man, the Holy
One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath. They shall go after Yahweh; he
will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from
the west. ~11:8-10_

How can
we not fear and love a God like this? His compassion stays his hand of judgment
and overflows in undeserved mercy on those who have scorned him. He withholds
his wrath, not because he is weak but rather because he is strong. He will
rescue his people and deliver them from the effects of their sin. That's why I
think that the imagery of a lion here is so striking; the picture of a lion
here is not a picture of judgment but of mercy---mighty mercy. The rescue is
pictured as God roaring like a lion, summoning his people out of exile. 

And yet,
remember: a roaring lion is a terrifying thing, able to be heard from miles
around. This speaks to the reality that the rescue that God is about to
undertake is not a small, weak thing. This rescue is a vast in its reach and
frightening in its power. 

And the response
that this rescue calls for is that of gospel fear: "When he roars, his children
shall come trembling from the west;" those whom he calls will come trembling
out of exile and punishment.

What kind
of lion is this---mighty in mercy, whose roar saves and doesn't devour? We're not
told in Hosea, but one of the Old Testament's first messianic prophecies points
the way. In Genesis 49 comes the promise of a reigning, rescuing Lion, when
Jacob is pronouncing prophetic blessings over each of his twelve sons, from
whom would come the twelve tribes of Israel. To his son Judah, he said:

__

_Judah is a lion's
cub; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down; he crouched as a
lion and as a lioness; who dares rouse him? The scepter shall not depart from Judah,
nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him, and to
him shall belong the obedience of the peoples. ~Genesis 49:10_

Judah is
pictured as a dangerous lion---"who dares rouse him?" And yet this lion isn't
wild or out of control; rather, this lion reigns as a king, and the prophecy
states that "the obedience of the peoples"---that is, of all different nations,
tribes, languages, and people groups---would belong to him.

True to
those prophetic words, the kingship of Israel did indeed come through Judah's
line when his descendent David took the throne. But the words of the prophecy
push past David, saying that the kingly scepter would remain in Judah and
David's line 

_until_

Judah's Lion
finally arrives and claims the obedience of the nations. Who, then, is this reigning,
roaring Lion that Genesis and Hosea speak of?

LION AND
LAMB

The answer,
we know, is Jesus. And yet, when the rightful heir of David's throne, the King
of all kings, broke into human history on a silent night in Bethlehem, he
didn't look like Judah's Lion. He didn't arrive in majesty or power; he carried
no scepter and seemed to not wield any authority at all. In fact, he didn't
look anything like a king, or seem to be anything like a lion. Where was the
roar that would summon God's people into salvation? Where was the fierce kingly
power that Jacob foresaw? For a people eagerly expecting the Lion of Judah, the
long-awaited Messiah did not look like what they anticipated.

The rest
of his life and ministry was a further surprise. This King hadn't come to
demand tribute, but to heal and bless and forgive. This Lion hadn't come to be
served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many (Matthew 20:28).
As John the Baptist said, the Lion looked a lot more like a lamb, a sacrificial
lamb that had come to quietly give its life in the place of guilty sinners
(John 1:29).

And yet
he really was the Lion of Judah who was promised. He really was David's King who
would rule the world and own the obedience of every people group on the planet.
His saving roar really would summon sinners from every corner of the globe. It
just didn't look the way we expected.

The
paradox of this lamb-like Lion is highlighted in Revelation 5, when the apostle
John is given a glimpse into the high drama unfolding behind the scenes in
heaven. He sees a scroll containing all of God's purposes for history and
humanity, and yet no one in heaven or earth is worthy to take up and fulfill all
of those purposes. John begins to weep in frustration, until an angel
interrupts him:

__

_And one of the
elders said to me, "Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the
Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven
seals." ~Revelation 5:5_

At last,
here is heaven's Hero, the one person in the universe qualified to undertake
all of God's saving plans---the Lion of Judah, David's King. Maybe now, in
heaven's light, we'll be able to see the Lion for who he really is:

__

_And between the throne
and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as
though it had been slain. ~Revelation 5:6_

The
angels says to John, "Look, the Lion of Judah!" And yet when John looks, he
"saw a Lamb, standing as though it had been slain." The Lion is the Lamb; the
Lamb is the Lion. And not just any Lamb; no, this is a slaughtered Lamb who,
though he had been slain, is now standing and reigning and carrying out God's
purposes.

Here is
the greatest wonder of the Bible, and perhaps the universe: Jesus Christ, the
Lion of Judah, heaven's Hero, the King of kings, is also the Lamb of God, the
suffering Servant, the meek and lowly One who gives his life for sinners. He is
unlike any other person in history; he is simultaneously majestic and meek,
holy and humble, terrifying and tender, forgiving and just, lion and lamb. This
is the contradictory, compelling glory of Jesus Christ: he holds children on
his knees and makes demons tremble; he tenderly woos sinners and violently
drives out hypocrites with a whip; he gently restores the broken and calms
storms and raises the dead with a word; he has all authority in heaven and
earth and yet submits to the will of his Father; he is the Author of life and
yet humbles himself to the point of death on a cross. That's why when John
looks at him, he sees both Lion of Judah and Lamb of God. Jesus Christ is both.

And that's
why, when the Lion-Lamb steps forward to fulfill all of the Father's purposes,
all of heaven erupts in wondrous worship:

__

_And they sang a new
song, saying, "Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you
were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and
language and people and nation, and you have made them a kingdom and priests to
our God, and they shall reign on the earth." ~Revelation 5:9-10_

Think back
to those Old Testament prophecies of the Lion, who would summon God's scattered
people with a terrifying roar and bend the obedience of every people group to
his rule... and then wonder to see the fulfillment here in Revelation 5\. The
obedience of the peoples that Genesis 49 prophesied was accomplished by the
ransom-paying blood of the Lamb, who "ransomed people for God from every tribe
and language and people and nation." The lion's roar that summons God's
trembling children---"when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the
west"--- is the death of Jesus. "

_By your
blood_

you ransomed people for God." The saving roar of Judah's Lion is the
triumphant, anguished cry of God's Lamb: "It is finished!" 

In
heaven's light, we can see the cross for what it really was: not the Lamb's
defeat, but rather the Lion's victory. With one sacrifice, Jesus accomplished
perfect forgiveness for all God's people (Hebrews 10:10), fully absorbed the
wrath of God (1 John 4:10), destroyed the power of the devil (Hebrews 2:14),
and purchased the worship of a worldwide body of redeemed saints (Revelation
5:9). The bloody slaughter of God's Lamb was the moment of highest triumph for
Judah's Lion.

TREMBLING
AT THE LION'S ROAR

That leaves
one huge application question for us as we consider these realities in relation
to fearing God: do you tremble at the Lion's roar? Hosea says that the response
of God's children to the Lion's saving roar is they will come trembling to him.
In light of what Revelation says the Lion's roar is---the ransoming death of
Jesus---this means that a crucial component of saving faith and repentance is 

_fear_

. This great Lion has stepped off of
heaven's throne and set aside all his glory and power to be the Lamb that we
need: a substitute for sinners, a sacrifice to pay for guilt, a price to pay
the ransom.

So what
is there to tremble at? First, tremble at the 

_cost_

. The infinitely precious blood of heaven's Hero was the price
required for your lust, your anger, your deceit. You stand today, freed from
the eternally crushing weight of sin's debt, because Another stepped into your
place and paid your debt at the cost of his own life. The cost of mercy should
cause us to tremble.

Second,
tremble at the

_glory_

of this
lamb-like Lion, who set aside his power and privilege to humble himself to the
lowest possible point: death on a cross. Jesus Christ is majestic and powerful,
a King who casts out demons and calms storms and upholds the universe by his
word of power and possesses all authority in heaven and on earth; Judah's Lion.
But he is also---at the same time---the meek and lowly Savior, the suffering
Servant, the Man of Sorrows, the one who held children on his knee and embraced
prostitutes and prodigals, who wept with Mary and went like a lamb to the
slaughter; the Lamb of God. And even today, as he reigns in power, he is still
both of these things: he stands victorious as the Lamb who was slain, receiving
all of heaven's worship; he fills the universe with his presence and yet stoops
to dwell in the hearts of his people; he inhabits eternity and dwells with the
lowly and contrite; he rejoices with omnipotent joy when one sinner repents.
The fact that Jesus is not merely meek nor merely majestic, but is simultaneously
both, makes him unlike any other person who has ever lived. The meekness and
majesty of Jesus is the shining center of his glory. Look into his life and
death---gaze long enough to see it---and you'll see this glory shining from everything
he says and does. And this beauty, this power, this glory, this love, should
cause us to tremble.

Third, tremble
at the 

_reason _

that this Glorious One
laid down his life: he did it for you. Weak, sinful, wandering, broken you.
You, who daily spurn his glory and live for your own fragile kingdom. You, who
ignore his great worth and inflate your own. You, the wandering sheep who has left
his kind ways a thousand times and have been carried back on his shoulder, time
and time again. You, whose mocking voice and sinful hands drove the nails that
cost him his life. You, his beloved, his treasure and inheritance, the apple of
his eye. What kind of lion, what kind of king would do this? Only the greatest
possible King, only the most wonderful kind of Lion. In light of how we have broken
the King's heart with our spiritual adultery, we deserve nothing but judgment
from his hand. And yet as you see all your sin forgiven at such a great cost
and all your guilt swallowed up in his goodness, what possible response could
there be other than to stand in wonder, return to him with trembling, and join
heaven's anthem, 

__

_"Worthy is the Lamb
who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and
glory and blessing!" ~Revelation 5:12_

He isn't
safe, but he is good, and what good news that is indeed!

****

**CHAPTER 4- STANDING ON THE STONE
OF STUMBLING**

**__**

**_Let him be your
fear, and let him be your dread. And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of
offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel. ~Isaiah 8:13-14_**

Solid
rock is a good thing or a dangerous thing, depending on the context. It can be
the foundation on which you build your house, or the landslide that destroys an
entire neighborhood. A mountain can be majestic and beautiful---or it can be an
insurmountable, immovable obstacle. Sometimes rock can even be both dangerous
and good at the same time. To a ship in a storm, solid rock means a shipwreck.
But if your boat runs aground and you find yourself adrift in that storm, the
same rock that destroyed your ship is your only hope of safety---your life
depends on getting to solid ground. The paradox of rock is that it can be
life-taking and life-giving, both dangerous and good.

That's
why, throughout the Bible, Jesus Christ is referred to as a solid rock.
Sometimes that metaphor is a picture of stability, foundation, and security.
Other times it's a picture of crushing, judgment, and stumbling. And
surprisingly, sometimes it's both.

In
Isaiah, we have a prophecy of the coming Messiah as a precious foundation and
cornerstone who will be a source of safety for his people:

__

_Behold, I am laying
a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, of a
sure foundation: whoever believes will not be in haste. ~Isaiah 28:16_

Jesus
picks up on that imagery when he promises that those who trust in him and build
their lives on his precious words will be like those who build a house on a
firm foundation:

__

_Everyone who hears
these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house
on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and
beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the
rock. ~Matthew 7:24-25_

But the
prophet Isaiah also said this about Jesus, the solid rock:

__

_He will become a
sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of
Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many shall
stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.
~Isaiah 8:14-15_

Therefore,
the same Savior who offered himself as a foundation and shelter in the storm
also said this to those who refused to put their trust in him as their solid
rock:

__

_He looked directly
at them and said, "What then is this that is written: 'The stone that the
builders rejected has become the cornerstone?' Everyone who falls on that stone
will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him. ~Luke
20:17-18_

The same
Rock that is a precious cornerstone and sure foundation to those who believe is
also the Rock that breaks and crushes those who stumble in unbelief. The
parallels are striking: Jesus is the "precious cornerstone," and "a trap and
snare." The Solid Rock is both a trap and a treasure. And go back and look at
Isaiah 8:14 again and you'll see both realities brought together in the same
verse: "He will become a

sanctuary 

_and_

a stone of offense." He is either a
trap or a treasure, a sanctuary or a stone of offense; the difference depends
on how you respond to him.

As we've
unfolded the gospel heart of fearing God through the last couple chapters,
we've seen a lot of paradoxes, haven't we? He is the forgiving God who will by
no means clear the guilty; he is both the Lion of Judah and the Lamb of God.
Here is yet another glorious paradox: Jesus Christ is a perilous source of
dangerous security. I love that seeming contradiction; it's the essence of his
glory that he is merciful and mighty, majestic and meek, lion and lamb, both
storm and shelter, trap and treasure, sanctuary and stone of offense. One key
to fearing God with an appropriate gospel fear is to see how all these
contradictions come together in the compelling and utterly unique character of
God's Son.

DON'T
MESS WITH MERCY

In Acts
chapter 4, the apostle Peter was on trial before the Jewish high council for
daring to preach that Jesus is the Savior. Peter---whose own name, given to him
by Jesus, means "rock"---points the religious leaders to Psalm 118:22, a prophecy
about Jesus being the cornerstone rejected by the builders, and he urged the
leaders to come back to the salvation that they had rejected:

__

_This Jesus is the
stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.
And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven
given among men by which we must be saved. ~Acts 4:11-12_

In
architecture, a cornerstone is the essential element that holds up the walls of
a building. Remove the cornerstone, and the entire structure will collapse. The
fact that Jesus is the cornerstone means that he alone holds up the entire
edifice of salvation. He is the only shelter strong enough to provide
protection from divine judgment, because he alone was worthy to absorb all our
sins on the cross and rise triumphant over them. To reject him, therefore, is
nothing less than everlasting catastrophe, because salvation can only be found
in him.

Suddenly,
the words of the song, "On Christ The Solid Rock I Stand" take on a little more
urgency:

__

_My hope is built on
nothing less_

__

_Than Jesus' blood
and righteousness;_

__

_I dare not trust the
sweetest frame_

__

_But wholly lean on
Jesus' name._

__

_On Christ, the solid
Rock, I stand;_

__

_All other ground is
sinking sand._

Do you
hear the fearful urgency of the hymn? "

_All_

other ground is sinking sand;" his cross is the only place of safety that will
stand in the storm of divine judgment. There is no other salvation, no other
rescue, no other safety except in the name of Jesus. That's why it says, "I 

_dare not_

trust the sweetest frame" In
other words, to put my hope in any other place than Jesus' blood and
righteousness is to find myself opposed to the Solid Rock and outside his
saving shelter. When Jesus is both precious cornerstone and stumbling stone,
you don't mess around with his grace or play games with his promises of safety.

That's
why that prophecy in Isaiah 8 comes prefaced like this:

__

_Let him be your
fear, and let him be your dread. And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of
offense and a rock of stumbling._

"Let him
be your fear," Isaiah commands. Why would you fear a sanctuary? Because the
sanctuary is also a stone of offense, a rock of stumbling, a trap and snare to
those who fail to come to him in faith. The gospel's free offer of gracious
sanctuary is not an offer to be taken lightly. Don't mess with this kind of
mercy.

HIDING IN
THE ROCK OF AGES

In June
of the year 1776, as the American revolution was igniting across the Atlantic,
the English pastor Augustus Toplady found himself caught outside in a violent
thunderstorm. Looking for shelter, he saw a limestone cliff with a small cleft
worn into it, and was able to press his way into it. Safely ensconced behind
the rock, he was able to safely wait out the storm. While he sheltered there,
his mind was drawn to the words of Isaiah 26:4, which in the English translation
of his day read, "Trust ye in Yahweh forever, for in Yahweh God is the rock of
ages." Moved by the power of the storm and the security of his shelter, he
wrote his most famous hymn while the thunder rolled outside his sanctuary:

__

_Rock of ages, cleft
for me,_

__

_Let me hide myself
in Thee;_

__

_Let the water and
the blood,_

__

_From Thy wounded
side which flowed,_

__

_Be of sin the double
cure;_

__

_Save from wrath and
make me pure._

Jesus
Christ, the precious cornerstone, is the Rock of Ages, and the only salvation
from wrath and sin is to hide yourself in him. The sheltered harbor of his
mercy is the only refuge from wrath, because he has already borne the entire
divine punishment for everyone who trusts in him. And so, just like Toplady
sheltered in the cleft in the limestone cliff and watched the storm go by,
everyone in Christ will watch the storm of divine judgment pass by them, and
they will emerge into eternity unscathed.

The next
two verses of Toplady's hymn echo the urgency of "On Christ The Solid Rock I
Stand" by affirming that only Jesus' death and resurrection provide sufficient
safety for the sinner:

__

_Not the labor of my
hands_

__

_Can fulfill Thy
law's demands;_

__

_Could my zeal no
respite know,_

__

_Could my tears
forever flow,_

__

_All for sin could
not atone;_

__

_Thou must save, and
Thou alone._

__

_Nothing in my hands
I bring,_

__

_Simply to Thy cross
I cling;_

__

_Naked, come to Thee
for dress;_

__

_Helpless, look to
Thee for grace;_

__

_Foul, I to the
Fountain fly;_

__

_Wash me, Savior, or
I die._

These two
verses encapsulate what gospel fear looks like: recognizing the futility of
even our best works, and that "Thou must save, and Thou alone." The best labors
of my hands could never fulfill his Law's perfect demands; all my righteous
deeds are like filthy rags in comparison to his spotless perfection (Isaiah
64:6). My best deeds are not sufficient to qualify me for grace; even if I had
unflagging zeal for God and perfect tears of repentance, I would be unable to
pay the costly ransom for my soul and atone for my own sin. To think that I
could somehow earn God's favor by obedience is the height of folly and
arrogance; to think that way betrays that I either grossly overvalue my worth
or grossly undervalue God's. At the end of the day, if I am to have any hope of
standing before God and emerging unscathed, he must do the saving. I am utterly
dependent on his mercy. "Wash me, Savior, or I die."

That's
where gospel fear starts, but that's not where it ends. Verse 3 unpacks the
correct response to a holy God of wrath and love: "Nothing in my hands I bring,
simply to Thy cross I cling." This is the liberating good news of the gospel,
and the central joy in fearing God: the death of Jesus is enough. His spilled
blood is sufficient to atone for all my sins. His perfect life is sufficient
righteousness to qualify me to stand before God. There's nothing for me to do,
nothing to earn, nothing to bring; rather, I simply cling to what he has done,
what he has earned, what he has brought to me.

Yes,
coming to Jesus for this kind of salvation requires owning up to the humbling
fact that I'm "naked...helpless...foul," which is probably why so many people
stumble over the sanctuary instead of coming inside and finding salvation. But
for those who fear God---who tremble at his wrath and holiness and come to Jesus
for shelter---they find everything they need: robes of righteousness for their
nakedness, grace upon grace for their helplessness, and thorough cleansing from
their foulness. Our greatest need is rescue from the wrath of God, and in Jesus
we have everything we need. He is the Rock of Ages, the precious cornerstone,
the sure foundation, the sanctuary, the only one in whom there is salvation.

The song
of the soul who stands on the Stumbling Stone, who has found in Jesus a refuge
from wrath and a rock of salvation, sings with joy. What else could we do, we
who have in Jesus everything we need? The song of Psalm 18 will be our anthem
forever:

__

_I love you, O
Yahweh, my strength! Yahweh is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my
God, my rock in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the strength of my
salvation, my stronghold._

****

**CHAPTER 5- FEAR THE RIGHT THINGS**

**__**

**_Do not fear those
who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both
soul and body in hell. ~Matthew 10:28_**

There's a
funny story from the life of Jesus in Mark 4\. One day, Jesus and his disciples
cross over the Sea of Galilee in a small fishing boat, and during the
three-hour tour (cue the Gilligan's Island theme), Jesus falls asleep in the
back of the boat. I guess it had been a long day, and the Creator and Sustainer
of the universe needed a nap (actually, spend a moment pondering in wonder at
the frail humanity of the Savior). A violent storm whips up out of nowhere---a
common occurrence on this particularly large lake, and soon the boat is in
danger of sinking. Here's what the text says:

__

_A great windstorm
arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already
filling. But Jesus was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him
and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"_

Jesus
went on snoozing right through the storm, even as the boat was actively filling
with water. (Didn't he notice he was getting increasingly wet? I guess he
really, really needed that nap). The disciples---trained fishermen who had spent
their entire life on this lake, by the way---were panicking, and in desperation
they woke him up and accused him of not caring about their lives. 

Don't we
do that so often? In the midst of crisis, when the storm seems big and the
Savior seems small, have you ever said, "Don't you care about me, God?" That
small voice whispers that if God really loved you, he wouldn't put you through
that trial. If you've ever been tempted to doubt his goodness in the midst of
life's storm, you're in familiar company; get in the boat with the rest of the
doubting disciples.

In
response to their faithless accusations (and rude interruption of his nap), I
love Jesus' response:

__

_And he awoke and
rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased,
and there was a great calm. He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Have you
still no faith?"_

With the
serenity of absolute sovereignty, Jesus stands up in the tossing boat, probably
yawns and stretches, and then calmly tell the storm to knock it off. No
theatrics, no sleight of hand or flourishing gesture, no great loud voice of
command. He simply says, "Stop," and the storm stops. 

This is
breathtaking divine power on full display. Jesus displays absolute authority
over the elements. Even the weather obeys his casual command. The One who spoke
every molecule of air and water into existence still owns their obedience, and
they still listen to his voice. Weather bows to his will.

The
disciples, however, are another story. If you had been in the boat with Jesus,
what do you think your response would have been? Glad thankfulness that your
life had been spared? Rejoicing and whooping and hugging each other? Sober
reflection that you had come so close to death? Those would all make sense. But
what about sheer terror?

__

_And they were filled
with great fear and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind
and sea obey him?"_

In
response to Jesus' calming the storm, the disciples were not happy, or
relieved, or thankful. They were scared spitless. They were "filled with great
fear," Mark tells us. The NIV translates it as, "They were terrified." They had
been afraid during the storm, but now that the sun is suddenly shining, they're
terrified. Why?

It's
because these Jewish fishermen know their Old Testaments. They know verses like
Psalm 89:8-9:

__

_O Yahweh God of
hosts, who is mighty as you are, O Yahweh, with your faithfulness all around
you? You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them._

They know
the Scriptures that talk of the Great I Am calming the waves of the sea. They
know prophecies that speak of God's sovereignty over wind and rain. They know
that weather only obeys the word of one Person. And so as the sun ripped
through the disappearing storm clouds and the wild wind turned to a gentle
breeze, they turned with trembling to the One who stood calmly in the back of
the boat and realized that this was no ordinary man. "Who then is this, that even
the wind and sea obey him?" they whispered fearfully. They had been afraid in
the storm, but now they were terrified, because something more frightening than
the storm was in the boat with them.

GETTING
YOUR FEAR PRIORITIES RIGHT

The
disciples learned a valuable lesson that day: fear the right things. In a world
full of dangers, toils, and snares, the question is not "Will I be afraid?" but
rather, "Will I fear the right things?" We all intuitively understand this to
some level: a tiny little spider on a web outside is less frightening than a
giant, hairy arachnid crawling across your bed. One you might simply avoid; the
other makes you scream like a little girl and run out of the room. Riding a
roller coaster is less frightening than skydiving out of a plane. Although both
of those things might make you scream like a little girl.

You and I
make decisions every day based on calculating risks like these. We hurtle
around all day in speeding steel death traps, but try to mitigate the danger by
installing air bags and wearing seat belts. We cook our food on open flames inside
our flammable houses, but install smoke detectors and fire alarms and buy fire
insurance. Every day is full of risks and things to be afraid of, but many of
them we calculate away or take steps to avoid or accept as the cost of normal
life.

And then
there are irrational fears, like the fear of going outside---agoraphobia. Yes, I
suppose you could be hit by a meteor when you step outside, or run over when
you cross the street, but you and I all know that dealing with those risks by
fearfully refusing to leave your house isn't healthy. Phobias are what happen
when a fear---perhaps justified, often unjustified---grows outside the bounds of
rationality and starts to control your behavior beyond what reason would
dictate.

But what
about some other fears that seem rational or normal, but which God warns
against? Like anxiety about money? That's one I'm currently struggling with:
how am I going to pay all the bills this month? I've crunched the budget and
the numbers don't add up. It took me over an hour to fall asleep the other
night because I kept running over budget scenarios in my head, filling up my
heart with anxiety about the future. We'd all probably agree that it's not a good
thing to stress about money---and God clearly tells us not to do it---and yet most
of us do it anyway.

Or what
about what the Bible calls "the fear of man," the desire to look good in front
of others and please people because you worry about what they think of you. Calculating
what you say based on what you anticipate their response would be, being
consumed with being popular and liked and admired, etc. Everybody does that,
right?

Or what
about our story of Jesus and his disciples in the storm? After he rebuked the
storm, he rebuked his disciples: "Why are you so afraid? Have you still no
faith?" I've wondered a lot about that stinging question. I think I would have
answered, "Um, Jesus, I was afraid because the boat was sinking. The danger was
real: 

_I was going to die._

" 

Jesus,
however, seemed to think about it differently. He criticizes their lack of
faith, as if to say, "If I'm in the boat, you don't need to worry about the
storm. The fact that you were still worried about the storm means you don't
think I'm big enough to handle it."

You see,
many of the fears and worries that we explain away as normal fall under the
same criticism that the disciples faced: "Why are you so afraid? Have you still
no faith?" Our problem is not that those things aren't big deals; the problem
is that we fail to see that God is a much, much bigger deal. The problem with
worrying about money is not that I don't have budget problems; the issue is
that I am ignoring God's clear promises, things like, "My God will supply all
of your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus" (Philippians
4:19) or "Keep your life free from the love of money, for I will never leave
you nor forsake you" (Hebrews 13:5). When I worry about what people think of me
and base my behavior on their approval, it's because I consider their approval
to be a bigger deal than God's approval. Fear of man is what happens when
people are big in my heart, and God is small. We forget the clear-cut command
implicit in Galatians 1:10: "Am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God?
Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not
be a servant of Christ."

So how do
we combat these misplaced, faithless fears? The incredible answer that the
Bible gives is not simply, "Don't fear." Rather, the Bible's answer is, "Fear
the right things." It will turn out, when we start to dig into the Bible's
words, that the solution to anxiety and fear of man and every other faithless
fear is to get our fear priorities right, and start fearing God more.

DON'T
FEAR WHAT THEY FEAR

In Isaiah
chapter 8, which we looked at in the previous chapter, this command to "fear
the right things" is laid out explicitly. At this point in history, God's
people were frightened at the prospect of a rumored Assyrian invasion. All the
talk in the town was whether or not the Assyrians would attack, and what the
king was going to do about it. Rumors and conspiracies and fear filled the air.
And this fear was justifiable: the Assyrians were a mighty, bloodthirsty,
ruthless empire, and little Judah was a weak provincial kingdom. So we might
understand if God was sympathetic to their fears. But he wasn't. God warned
Isaiah not to take part in their faithless rumor-mongering:

__

_Yahweh spoke to me
with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this
people, saying, "Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy,
and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread. But Yahweh Almighty, him you
shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he
will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both
houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many
shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and
taken. ~Isaiah 8:11-15_

"Don't be
like this people," God told Isaiah. "They're consumed with conspiracy theories
and terror. But I'll tell you what should terrorize you: Me." Are you surprised
that God would talk like that? Look again at the text: "Do not fear what they
fear, nor be in dread. But Yahweh Almighty, him you shall honor as holy. 

_Let him be your fear, and let him be your
dread._

" "Don't be in dread of the Assyrians; be in dread of me." That's a
sobering thing for the God of the universe to say. Verses like this are in the
Bible in order to blow up our nice, little, safe views of God. You can't walk
very long through the biblical landscape without stepping on a landmine like
this.

A good
question to ask of this text would be, "Why is God more frightening than the
Assyrians?" That's exactly the question that God answers. "Let him be your
dread. And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling
to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be
snared and taken."

In the
previous chapter, I said that the ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy is
found in Jesus, who was the promised Rock of Stumbling and the Cornerstone
whose coming caused many in Israel to stumble and fall into destruction. That's
true, but the prophecy also has an immediate warning for the people of Isaiah's
day. God is saying to them, "Don't fear what the Assyrians can do; fear my
judgment, and be in dread of falling into destruction when I judge you." God is
warning Isaiah to have the right fear priorities, to fear most what is most
frightening. And for the God of the universe to pronounce judgment on you is
truly the most frightening thing in the universe.

THE FEAR
OF MAN AND THE FEAR OF GOD

Jesus---the
promised Sanctuary and Stone of Offense---picks up on this prophetic pattern in
his own words to his disciples and to us. In Matthew 10, Jesus gives some very
strange comfort to his fearful disciples. Jesus had just given them---and us---a glorious,
dangerous mission: 

__

_"Proclaim as you go,
saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' "Heal the sick, raise the dead,
cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay...
Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves."_

Jesus
commissioned his apostles on a mission of mercy---mercy received and mercy given.
"You received mercy freely," Jesus reminded them. They were the recipients of
amazing, undeserved grace. "Now go and give it to others just as freely." And
the same Savior has given us the same mission: to be conduits of free grace,
healing, and restoration, heralding the arriving kingdom to a world that needs
redemption.

But Jesus
also promised that this message of mercy would not be received well by the
world: "I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves," he said. "They
will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues... and you will
be hated by all for my name's sake." The cost of following Jesus in his mission
to make mercy known to the ends of the earth will be great. It will cost every
Christ-follower some of their security, their comfort, and their dreams. It
will cost others their reputation, or their friends, or their jobs. And it will
cost some their lives.

Needless
to say, the cost of following Jesus is a frightening thing. In your comfortable
American lifestyle, this may seem to be a distant concept to you, but for many
of your brothers and sisters around the world, that fear is a daily reality. And
yet the cost of discipleship is real, regardless of your context: "If anyone
would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me"
(Matthew 16:24). Genuine discipleship always comes with a cost.

In the
face of the high cost of discipleship and mission, Jesus has a strange word of
comfort. In verses 26-33, Jesus gives a three-fold argument for fighting fear. It's
the same logic God used with Isaiah. What Jesus says boils down to this: "Fearing
God disarms every lesser fear." His logic can be unpacked into three smaller
arguments: the coming great reversal, the reality of hell, and the Father's
absolute sovereignty. We'll take those arguments one by one so that Jesus'
logic can begin to form a foundation of fearlessness in your life. And while
the immediate context of his words is mission, his logic applies more broadly, working
to free you from every anxiety and fear in your life.

THE COMING
GREAT REVERSAL

After all
his sober warnings of persecution, Jesus comforts his disciples by pointing
them to a coming great reversal:

__

_"So have no fear of
them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not
be known. What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear
whispered, proclaim on the housetops." ~Matthew 10:26-27_

Don't be
afraid, Jesus says, because a great reversal is coming; everything covered will
be revealed and everything hidden will be made known. Even though it seems like
darkness is winning, dawn is almost here, and the light of justice will soon
expose every evil. Every cover-up will be brought out into the light, and every
secret sin will be known and seen. Every wrong will be made right, everything
sad will come untrue, everything broken will be fixed, every injustice will be
punished, every sin judged. And no earthly power will survive that cataclysmic
day.

The
apostle Peter speaks of this coming great reversal when he writes,

__

_The day of the Lord
will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and
the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the
works that are done on it will be exposed. ~2 Peter 3:10_

The great
day of the Lord, the great reversal, will explode on this world with the omnipotent
power of God's wrath. "The heavens will pass away with a roar" and the sky will
be rolled up like a scroll. But when the judgment reaches beyond the natural
world to people, the results will be far more devastating: "the earth and the
works that are done on it will be exposed." Every deed written in God's books
of judgment will be revealed, and every person will be called to account. This
is not a judgment that you could possibly hide from: "No creature is hidden
from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we
must give account" (Hebrews 3:13). 

In
Revelation 6, we are given a clear picture of this great reversal when every
deed is exposed and every earthly power crumbles, a judgment that no one can
hide from:

__

_The sky vanished
like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and island was
removed from its place. Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the
generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid
themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, calling to the
mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated
on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of their wrath
has come, and who can stand?" ~Revelation 6:14-17_

"The
great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?" all the inhabitants of
the earth wail. And note the universal scope of this reversal: every earthly
power---"the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich
and the powerful"---cower before the wrath of the Lamb, but this reversal is not
limited to them. "And 

_everyone_

, slave
and free, hid themselves." This day that Jesus speaks of, when every hidden
thing is brought into the open and every darkness is exposed, will shatter
every soul, and there will be no escape.

Now stop
and consider for a moment this extraordinary thought: the horrible reality of
looming judgment is what Jesus is using to 

_comfort_

his disciples! "Have no fear of them, because nothing is covered that will not
be revealed," he says. In other words, "Don't be afraid, because my omnipotent
wrath and omniscient judgment will soon overtake all my enemies." 

The only
way that this can be a comforting thought is if we are no longer his enemies.
And because of the cross, that's exactly what has happened to us. "Greater love
has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends... I have
called you friends" (John 15:13,15). We who deserve to be included in that
terrible judgment have been rescued from wrath by the One who bore all our sins
on the cross and endured the punishment we deserve. The Lamb who is coming soon
to bring wrath first came to take away wrath for all who trust him. Knowing not
only that a great reversal is coming, but that we will survive that flood and
emerge unscathed, provides great confidence against anxiety and fear.

THE
REALITY OF HELL

Jesus
continues his argument by building on what he said about the coming great
reversal. Now he turns our attention to an even more surprising argument: the
reality of hell as an antidote for fear.

__

_And do not fear
those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can
destroy both soul and body in hell. ~Matthew 10:28_

I love
this verse. Only Jesus could use hell as an argument against anxiety; he's cool
like that. "Don't be afraid of people," Jesus says. "The worst they can do is
kill you!" If that sounds like strange comfort, it's probably because we think
of death as the worst possible thing. But Jesus' argument here pushes an
eternal perspective on us---a perspective that, if we truly embrace it, will
liberate us from a multitude of fears.

A 17

th

century preacher, William Gurnall, commented on this verse: "We fear men so
much, because we fear God so little. One fear cures another. When man's terror
scares you, turn your thoughts to the wrath of God." Jesus is calling us here
to right-size our views of God, of eternity, and of people, because we've got
it all backwards. God seems to us to be relatively insignificant and harmless.
This life seems very long and most real and most important. And people---their
approval or disapproval---seem like a really big deal.

But Jesus
is graciously and firmly saying to us, "You've got it backwards." God is
massively significant, infinitely valuable, and ferociously holy and glorious.
This present life is a vapor, a mist, a breath---and eternity is either endless
joy or endless torment. And people's approval and disapproval is
microscopically insignificant in light of these weighty realities. Isaiah 2:22
says it this way:

__

_Stop regarding man
in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?_

The
people whose approval you crave and disapproval you fear have exactly one
breath with which to affirm or discourage you. The breath that is currently in
their lungs is the only one that God has given them, the only one that they're
promised (and for that matter, the breath currently in 

_your_

lungs is the only one you've been promised too). If, in his
wisdom and good purposes, God decides to give them another breath, and another...
well, he knows what he is doing and he promises to take care of you in the
process. What's the worst they can do to you? Kill you? Okay, so they kill you.
If you're in Christ, that means they lose and you win.

The truth
is, death is not the worst possible thing. In fact, for the Christian, death is
gain (Philippians 1:21). Compared to the length and breadth of eternity, this
life is a fleeting vapor, a mere breath. For the believer, this present life is
but a few days of hardship and sacrifice, and then we enter into the
everlasting joy of our master and take possession of our inheritance. But
conversely, for the unbeliever, this present life is but a few days of
transient pleasures and shallow joys before the darkness of everlasting
judgment descends. If you're a believer, the worst moment in this life is the
closest you will ever get to hell. But if you're an unbeliever and persist in
your unbelief, the best moment in this life is the closest you will ever get to
heaven.

David
captures the wisdom of this eternal perspective when he prays in Psalm 39:

__

_O Yahweh, make me
know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am!
Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing
before you. Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath! Surely mankind goes
about as a shadow! ~Psalm 39:4-6_

Does that
sound like a bummer of a prayer to you? "Let me know how fleeting I am!" You
might be tempted to think that that's a recipe for a morose, gloomy life, but
Jesus seems to disagree. The eternal perspective of Matthew 10:29 is not a
recipe for gloom but for joy, not for depression but for fearlessness. This is
the path to freedom.

But the
way that Jesus leads us into that fearless joy is surprising. He doesn't do it
by directing our attention to heaven. He does it with a sober warning about
hell. "Fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell." 

Matthew
25:46 says that hell is "eternal punishment." 2 Thessalonians elaborates on
this punishment: "They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away
from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might." This everlasting
destruction, however, doesn't mean that unbelievers are snuffed out and cease
to exist; that would be welcome relief compared to what Revelation 14:11 says:
"The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest,
day or night." Mark 9:37 says that hell is "unquenchable fire." In Matthew
13:50, Jesus described hell as "the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth." Hell is unending torment, and everlasting grief, cut
off forever from all that is good or beautiful. There is nothing worse, nothing
more terrifying, than this horror.

Jesus'
recipe for fearlessness starts with reorienting your fears around that which is
truly frightening. In the light of eternity, the worst that people can do to
you is insignificant. What else is there to be afraid of, really?

THE
FATHER'S ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY

The third
part of Jesus' argument for fearlessness lays a solid foundation of confidence
underneath the coming great reversal and the reality of hell: if the God who
executes this kind of judgment loves you and is on your side, nothing should
make you afraid. Jesus' third argument goes like this: what God values most
highly is most secure.

__

_Are not two sparrows
sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your
Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore;
you are of more value than many sparrows. ~Matthew 10:29-31_

Jesus
draws our attention to the insignificant details of this world: sparrows and
hair. Your hair falls out and grows in all the time without you even noticing.
Two sparrows, he says, are sold at market for a penny. And yet every one of
those sparrows---which are so small and common as to be practically worthless---are
each known by God and under his constant sovereign supervision. And every
strand of hair on your head is known and numbered by God himself. 

Note
carefully what Jesus is saying, because this will make all the difference in
the world if we get it right. Jesus doesn't

merely say that no sparrow falls to the ground without God's knowledge.
This is not a statement about how God knows the details of every bird's life,
proving the vastness of God's omniscience. Of course, it's true that God is
aware of every detail in the universe; that's just not what Jesus is saying
here. He's not saying that God is 

_aware _

of
every detail in the universe; he's saying that God is in direct, intimate,
sovereign 

_control _

of every detail in
the universe.

Not one
insignificant sparrow anywhere on the planet ever falls off of any limb "apart
from your Father." He is intimately involved in the life and times and death of
every creature in the universe. Just like every detail of every day of your
life was written in his book before one of them ever came to pass (Psalm
139:16), so also with the sparrows: every detail of every day of every bird
that has ever lived is orchestrated by the sovereign hand of God himself. Deep
in the extended reaches of the Amazon rainforest, where no human being has ever
set foot and where hundreds of species have lived and died undiscovered for
millennia, God is in sovereign control. No egg ever hatches and no bird ever
dies "apart from your Father." He is intimately involved in every detail, every
moment, every life, and every death. Nothing is too small, too insignificant,
to escape the master plan of his omnipotent control. Even what appears to us as
random chaos is orchestrated by his sovereignty; even the dice obey him: "The
lot is cast in the lap, but its every decision is from Yahweh" (Proverbs
16:33).

When the
Bible speaks of God being sovereign, this is what it means: he holds every
molecule together.

Every atom moves
because he tells it to.

He holds all
power, all authority.

Every electron and
animal and person and planet and galaxy and angel and demon is under his
omnipotent governance.

His plan
encompasses and enfolds all events---every weather, every word, every random act,
every evil deed---all are subject to his sovereignty.

He has the authority and power to control all
things, and he does so at all times, without exception, for the glory of his
name and the good of his people.

If you
don't believe that, if that is not the joy and hope of your life, then your god
is too small, and Jesus' foundation for fearlessness will crumble in your life.
The Father that Jesus invites us to trust is a God who sets up and removes kings:
"It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the
earth, with the men and animals that are on earth, and I give it to whomever it
seems right to me" (Jeremiah 27:5). All political systems and leaders are
subject to his ultimate governance.

No
law, no ordinance, no election ever falls outside his sovereignty: "The
king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of Yahweh; he turns it wherever
he will" (Proverbs 21:1). He is sovereign over your entire life, and every
step that you take: "Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is
the purpose of Yahweh that will stand" (Proverbs 19:21). "The heart
of man plans his way, but Yahweh establishes his steps" (Proverbs 16:9). 

I am not
naïve as to the implications of this truth. History is a conveyor belt of
corpses. From the millions who perished in the Holocaust to the twenty children
murdered at Sandy Hook elementary school, to suicide, child abuse, loneliness, and
heartache, this world is filled with unspeakably horrific evil and suffering. The
notion that God could be sovereign over events like these is offensive. And yet
the Bible is clear: "See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside
me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; and there is none that can
deliver out of my hand" (Deuteronomy 32:39). "Does disaster come to a city,
unless Yahweh has done it?" (Amos 3:6) God does not shy away from offending us.
And if we will embrace the offense, we may just discover that what seemed like
an ugly doctrine is one of the sweetest, most precious truths in all the Bible.

You see,
we have not even begun to comprehend all that this means. The sovereignty of
God is unspeakably good news. Jesus says that the same God who reigns over the affairs
of kings and sparrows esteems you as greatly precious; in Christ, you are his
treasured possession and the apple of his eye. And this sovereign God is not
impersonal or immovable; Jesus explicitly tells us that he is our 

_Father_

. What a comfort to know that the
God who orchestrates electrons and elections relates to us as a father relates
to his children. 

Your
entire life, every moment of sweetness and suffering, is held by your Father
who loves you, who prizes you above all created things, who has made
indescribably wonderful promises to you, and has in himself all the power he
needs to fulfill every one of those promises.

Romans 8:28---ALL things work together for good for those who love God---is backed
up by a God who controls all things, governs all things, and is strong enough
to make every horror and heartache work for the eternal glory of those who love
Jesus. I find that amazing. This is assurance in the face of tragedy, a
foundation in the earthquake of uncertainty, and comfort in the midst of pain
knowing that you are not at the mercy of random chance---you are at the mercy of
a merciful and mighty God.

Do you
see now how Jesus' argument works here in Matthew 10? "Don't be afraid of those
who oppose you; if I am for you, who can possibly be against you? They will
perish in a moment when my wrath breaks on them, but you are secure in my love
forever. So you have nothing to be afraid of." The reality of a coming great
reversal and the horror of hell---a judgment we have been rescued from---makes any
opposition we face on the costly road of discipleship bearable; we win in the
end.

"If God
is for us, who can be against us?" Romans 8:31 asks. The answer, of course, is
that a lot of things can be against you: people can oppose you, circumstances
can weigh you down, and the spiritual forces of evil can array themselves
against you. At times it may seem like the entire world is against you. But the
point of Romans 8:31 is this: no one can 

_successfully_

be against you if God is on your side; every opposition is a temporary setback
and every trial is turned to everlasting good for those who love God. So at the
end of the day, what is there to be afraid of?

The logic
of this argument holds for every fear you face, not just persecution. You have
been rescued from the coming cataclysm, so every other struggle or fear you
will face today pales in comparison with what you've been rescued from, and
every opposition pales in comparison with the One who is on your side. You
experience every trial from the most secure position imaginable: held by the
omnipotent hand that has extinguished all judgments against you. Nothing can
shake you from that hand of love. "In all these things we are more than
conquerors through him who loved us" (Romans 8:37).

**CHAPTER 6- REJOICE WITH TREMBLING**

**__**

**_Serve the LORD with
fear, and rejoice with trembling. ~Psalm 2:11_**

Several
summers ago, my wife and I went to a nearby park for the annual 4

th

of July fireworks show. We got great seats, right on the grassy hill
overlooking the field where they set off the explosives. I love fireworks, and
this year was particularly spectacular. We were enthralled by the show, but
about halfway through the event, an approaching severe thunderstorm forced the
night to end early and sent us all scurrying to our cars.

That
night is burned into my memory because of a vivid shift in perspective that
happened right before the storm hit. We had been sitting on our blankets
marveling at the brightly colored fireworks, but our show was quickly dwarfed
as the rumbling, flashing bank of dark clouds rolled in. I can still remember
seeing the lightning exploding across the sky from a towering bank of storm
clouds behind the fireworks, and all of a sudden, our light show seemed puny by
comparison. Even the noise of "bombs bursting in air" was drowned out by the
rising wind and steady rumbling thunder.

The
incoming storm exposed our fireworks as the silly light show that they really
were. Moments before, we had been amazed by the lights and sounds. But now,
against the backdrop of the approaching storm, our biggest fireworks seemed
like the sparklers that kids hold in the backyard. They just weren't impressive
anymore, overshadowed by a vastly superior spectacle. God's fireworks were,
frankly, much better than ours.

I learned
a valuable lesson that night about worship and the fear of God. I

find myself so often enamored by the world's
toys and distracted from an undivided pursuit of God by admiring the fireworks
of worldly entertainment. The only thing that will set us free from the pursuit
of small-time shows is to behold a vastly superior spectacle.

Jesus
Christ is the greatest spectacle in the universe. His authority, love, power,
holiness, humility, justice, and mercy outshine and overshadow every other
glory. The greatest thrills in the world are like a meager fireworks show
compared to his greatness. The problem is, we're enamored by our own light
shows and toys. "Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and
exult," Isaiah 60:5 says about the sight of this glory. He is more thrilling
than the cheap toys that compete for our attention. What we need is a shift in
perspective, to see our pursuits and desires and hobbies and entertainment in
the light of his overwhelming beauty.

****

**HOLY, HOLY, HOLY**

Isaiah
got a glimpse of this spectacle one day in a vision that changed the course of
his life and ministry. While I don't anticipate getting the same kind of vision
that rocked his world, I trust that God put this account into his Word so that
the Holy Spirit could take the truth here and rock my world and yours as well
with the same power that changed Isaiah. 

__

_In the year that
King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and
the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had
six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and
with two he flew. And one called to the other and said, "Holy, holy, holy is
Yahweh Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory!" And the foundations of
the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled
with smoke._

Isaiah
tells us that this vision came during a time of change and turmoil in the
kingdom. King Uzziah, who had loved the Lord and presided over a long era of
national prosperity, had died. But in the midst of mourning and change, Isaiah
saw a glimpse of the undying King who was still sitting on his throne, still
ruling over his universe. When it says that "the train of his robe filled the
temple," we're supposed to get a picture of how spectacularly massive this king
is; the fringe of his garment fills the entire room. This brings to mind King
Solomon's words at the dedication of the temple: "Heaven and the highest heaven
cannot contain you, how much less this house I have built!" Seeing God face to
face, Isaiah must have recognized the reality of those words; this grand temple
that served as the center of Israel's worship couldn't even contain the corner
of the King's royal robes. All the systems of worship built around the temple
must have seemed ludicrously insufficient in that moment as Isaiah gazed on the
King, high and lifted up. Our songs don't do him justice, our sacrifices don't supply
anything to him, our services barely scratch the surface of who he is. A
shrinking feeling must have come over Isaiah in that moment as he realized that
all of his life of ministry and service didn't add anything to this King, as if
he needed anything. That's where true worship starts: realizing that the King
doesn't need you, but that you need the King.

All
around the King, Isaiah saw heavenly beings flying and endlessly singing
praise. The word "seraphim" in Hebrew literally means "burning ones." Throughout
Scripture, the appearance of these flaming angelic beings was enough to send
mortals cowering to the ground, but they themselves are obviously overcome by
the far superior spectacle of the King. Their strange appearance makes that
clear: "Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he
covered his feet, and with two he flew." Two wings covered the angels' eyes,
because even these "burning ones" could not look full on into the consuming
fire of God's holiness and survive. So they shield their eyes from the
brightness of his glory. Two other wings cover their feet, lest they disrespect
God by trampling his glorious presence. This brings to mind Moses standing
before the flaming presence of God, and God telling him: 

__

_"Do not come near;
take your sandals off your feet, for the place on which you are standing is
holy ground." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. ~Exodus
3:5-6_

Moses was
right to strip off his dirty shoes and shield his eyes; not even the heavenly
Burning Ones dare to look at God or get too close. And yet, even at their safe
distance, they cannot help but endlessly worship the One they catch glimpses
of. "Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh Almighty!" they cry. "The whole earth is full
of his glory!"

When the
flaming angels proclaim, "Holy, holy, holy!" they are doing more than just
repetition for the sake of redundancy. In Hebrew poetry, repeating something
twice adds emphasis; repeating something three times emphasizes the emphasis,
making it urgent and absolute. Saying something once, twice, or three times in
the Bible is like this:

Once-
beautiful

Twice- 

**very beautiful**

Three times- 

**__MOST PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL!__**

So when
the angels say, "Holy, holy, holy," they are shouting in bold, uppercase,
underlined letters, "

**_HE IS
ABSOLUTELY, PERFECTLY, INFINITELY, BREATHTAKINGLY HOLY!_**

" Do they have
your attention yet? They continue: "the entire world is filled with his glory,
with the radiance of his perfection!" The Self-Existent One, they say, is
infinitely holy, and the echo of his beauty and worth fills all of creation.

The word
"holy" doesn't just mean "morally perfect" like many people think it does.
Rather, the word "holy" has the idea of being set apart, different, unstained,
pure. The truth that God is holy means, in addition to him being morally
perfect, that he is utterly unique, set apart, and different. He is in a class
by himself. He is utterly unlike us, exalted high above our ability to
comprehend. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts," he says in Isaiah 55\.
That's a picture of just one facet of his holiness: comparing his thinking to
our thinking is like comparing an inch to a light year, or a candle to a
supernova. He is unique and set apart, different. Two chapters later, God is
described like this: "the One who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity,
whose name is Holy." He is exalted far above us, and even exists outside of
time---he "inhabits eternity." All of this is summed up in the phrase, "whose
name is Holy." His name, his very essence, is set-apartness.

Isaiah,
confronted with this set-apart One, the Holy King that even the Burning Ones
fear, fell on his face in terror.

__

_And I said: "Woe is
me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of
a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh Almighty!"_

"I am
lost!" Isaiah cried. Other translations render that as, "I am undone," or "I am
ruined." The Hebrew word that Isaiah uses has the idea of coming apart, of
being destroyed. "I am wrecked," he says, "because I am a man of unclean lips."
In the piercing blaze of the King's holiness, Isaiah becomes keenly aware of
his own sinfulness. This is especially poignant considering that in the
previous chapter, Isaiah had leveled "woe" after "woe" against God's rebellious
people. Six times in chapter 5 he pronounced prophetic woes against the rich
who forsake God's ways, the sinners who indulge themselves, the evil people who
love their sin, the moral relativists who call good evil and evil good, and
those who trust and admire their own wisdom. But now the light of God's
holiness is turned on him, and he pronounces his seventh woe... against himself.
"Woe is me!" is all he can say. He has been broken by the sin he sees all
around him, but now in God's presence, he is broken by the sin he sees in
himself.

In this
moment, as he sees his own sin in stark relief against God's dangerous
perfection, he knows there is no hope for him. "I'm lost, undone, wrecked,
because I'm a sinner in a land of sinners, and I've seen the King face to
face!" He has done what the angels dare not do; he has looked straight on the
face of Yahweh, and he knows he is ruined. Like a twig cast into the fire, he
expects to be turned to ash and annihilated by the consuming fire he sees.

That's
why what happens next is so surprising. Isaiah experiences not annihilation but
atonement; not destruction but deliverance.

__

_Then one of the
seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with
tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said, "Behold, this has
touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for."_

The fiery
angel goes to the altar---the place of sacrifice---and carefully picks up a coal
with tongs. I find that fascinating; this altar, this sacrifice, is too hot for
even the Burning Ones to touch. And yet this supernaturally hot coal is seared
right onto Isaiah's lips, a gracious, cleansing branding. What remains is a
scar of sinlessness: "Your guilt is taken away, and your sin is atoned for."

What is
this coal, this sacrifice that angels cannot approach and yet takes away the guilt
of sinners? Could it be that what Isaiah is experiencing here is the power of
the cross applied to his guilty lips? The sacrifice of Christ is what "angels
long to look into" (1 Peter 1:12), and Hebrews 10:19 tells us that only the
blood of Jesus gives us access into the holy presence of God. And so Isaiah's
only hope, even 700 years before the Savior arrives, is that God will relate to
him on the basis of that future sacrifice. Here in Isaiah we have a picture of
the grace that each of us who are in Christ have experienced: we are ruined,
guilty sinners in the presence of the King, but have been seared into
sinlessness, branded by the blood of Jesus---and all our guilt is gone.

FRIGHTENING
OR FUN?

Now let
me stop and ask an important question. On Sunday morning, when you enter church
and gather with believers to sing praise to this great King, you are coming
right into God's holy presence. Psalm 22:3 says that God is "enthroned on the
praises" of his people. That means that the sanctuary on Sunday morning is holy
ground---heaven's throne room. If, during the week, you gather with your small
group and begin with a couple worship songs, your living room is now a throne
room. God---the same God that Isaiah saw---is present among you. So what is your
response to that reality? Is your response anything like Isaiah's?

There
should be a real sense of trembling when we come into God's holy presence to
worship him. He is not a small god; he is not a tame lion. He is not like us,
and he is not safe. In Leviticus 10, two sons of the high priest Aaron presumed
to disregard the safety precautions that God had instituted for sinful people
to approach him, and "offered unauthorized fire before Yahweh. And fire came
out from before Yahweh and consumed them, and they died before Yahweh"
(Leviticus 10:1-2). God struck them down for their cavalier approach to
worship. God's explanation to their father, Aaron, was unapologetic: "Among
those who are near me I will be treated as holy, and before all the people I
will be glorified" (10:3). Or else.

And yet,
I've got to be honest: I don't get the sense---in my own heart or from those
around me---that we're particularly concerned about God being treated as holy
when we're singing on Sunday mornings. Aaron's sons were struck down for
offering unauthorized sacrifices; I wonder what the King thinks about the songs
we sing? Are we deeply concerned with singing rightly and biblically, honoring
God with accurate words about him and emotions that match the truth we
proclaim? Or do we want to be "entertained" by worship?

How do
you think about worship at your church? "That was a fun song!" "The band really
rocked today." "I didn't really like the songs we sang." "I was distracted
during worship." These betray our entertainment-centered vision of worship; we
view worship as being about us and our comforts and needs and emotions, instead
of being about the Holy One to whom we sing. We should tremble at such
outrageous abuse of our privileged access to the throne of grace.

THE ONLY
REASON YOU'RE NOT STRUCK DEAD FOR SINGING

The
sobering reality of our worship is this: the only difference between us and
Aaron's sons is not that we're somehow offering better worship than they did.
The only difference is that Jesus was struck dead in our place. The only reason
that you're not struck dead for your half-hearted singing is that the wrath of
God fell on Jesus instead of you. Rather, you have been granted extraordinary,
unparalleled, undeserved access: the God whom Isaiah saw has welcomed you into
free, unfettered fellowship with himself. 

That is the
frightening privilege that you have as a believer who, like Isaiah, has been
branded by the blood of Jesus. You have access that ancient Israel could only
dream of: access into the Most Holy Place, the very presence of God. Hebrews
10:19-22 opens the door for us to approach God himself:

__

_Therefore, brothers,
since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the
new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through
his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw
near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled
clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water._

You have
access to God that Isaiah could only dream of. God has promised to hear all
your prayers (John 14:14), accept all your praise and sacrifice (1 Peter 2:5),
never leave your side (Hebrews 13:5), always be with you (Matthew 28:20), take
up holy residence in your heart (John 14:17), and welcome you as blameless into
his glorious presence (Jude 24). Every one of those blessings was purchased at
great cost by the Son of God who bore every one of your failures to
appropriately honor and treasure the great worth of God. When Hebrews 10 says
that we have confidence to enter the holy places "through the curtain, that is,
through the flesh," that means that we draw near to God through nail wounds,
spilled blood, and torn flesh. That is the violent, costly grace that paid for
your singing on Sunday morning. The cross is the only "safety precaution" we
have, and the only safety precaution we need, when approaching God.

FEARFUL
GLADNESS

Those
twin realities---the dangerous holiness of God and the violent grace that paved
the way for you to enjoy fellowship with God forever---are at the heart of what a
lifestyle of biblical worship looks like. Psalm 2:11 describes it like this:

__

_Serve Yahweh with
fear, and rejoice with trembling._

"Rejoice
with trembling"---only those who, like Isaiah, have been branded with the blood
of Jesus can understand that contradictory emotion. Fearful gladness is the only
appropriate response for those who have been rescued with a violent grace:
gladness at the rescue, fear at the cost. So what does fearful gladness look
like?

In Isaiah
chapter 8, we are told that our response to this Holy One is supposed to be the
same as the Burning Ones who never cease to cry, "Holy, holy, holy!" "Yahweh
Almighty, him you shall honor as holy" (Isaiah 8:13). It means, he's not like
you, so don't treat him like he is. His thoughts are light years above our own;
give him the respect that someone like that deserves. He is unveiled brightness
and blinding perfection; don't treat him as common or ordinary. He's not common
or ordinary; he is exceptionally, infinitely valuable---and our own values
systems should reflect that. 

What does
that look like practically? It means giving the highest possible respect to his
words, because Infinite Wisdom has spoken to us. It means striving to obey him,
because Infinite Purity has commanded us. It means worshipping him with the joy
and passion he deserves, because Infinite Beauty has revealed himself to us. It
means grieving our sin and loving his mercy, because Infinite Grace has shed
his blood to forgive us. It means trusting him completely, because Infinite
Faithfulness has made unbreakable promises to us. It means pressing on to know
him and be with him, because Infinite Worth has invited us into relationship
with him.

And it
means having the same response that Isaiah had. Isaiah's worship in that moment
wasn't bored, distracted singing. It wasn't even happy clapping and dancing.
After the terror of seeing the King's face and the King's unexpected pardon
came the invitation from the King:

__

_And I heard the
voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I
said, "Here am I, send me." ~Isaiah 6:8_

Isaiah's
response to the holiness of God was, "I will go wherever you send me." Real
worship is more than a song; it is a living sacrifice (Romans 12:2) that lays
down everything at the feet of the Holy One and says, "Use me." Isn''t that
what Psalm 2:11 means? "

_Serve _

Yahweh
with fear; 

_rejoice _

with trembling."
True worship is both a fearful serving and a trembling rejoicing. It trembles
in wonder that the Holy One has rescued us, and then takes the news of that
great rescue to a world that needs to hear it. That means the worship service
doesn't end when you walk out the doors of the church; that's when the truest worship
begins.

**CHAPTER 7- LIVING IN THE EYE OF
THE HURRICANE**

**__**

**_Yahweh is good, a stronghold
in the day of trouble; he knows those who take refuge in him. But with an
overflowing flood he will make a complete end of the adversaries. ~Nahum 1:7-8_**

Full
disclosure: I'm a weather nerd. As a teacher in Maryland---a state just far
enough north to get snow, but just far enough south that it never knows what to
do with it---snow days are one of the great delights of my life. From November to
March, I'm a full-blown amateur meteorologist. I don't just listen to the news
to get the forecast; I follow weather blogs and pore over the raw satellite and
model data, all in the never-ending quest for a snow day. So yeah, I'm a major
weather nerd.

My
passion for meteorology started when I was a kid. I was especially fascinated
with hurricanes. My dad and I always talked about spending a summer "hurricane
hunting;" i.e., being those crazy people driving 

_towards_

a storm when everyone else was evacuating. We never got
around to it, although to this day we still talk about driving south when a
hurricane is in the news.

Just to
be clear; I do have a healthy respect for hurricanes and am not completely
nuts. I lived on the beach of a small South Pacific island through two
hurricanes, and experienced Superstorm Sandy in 2012 as it wreaked havoc in the
Mid-Atlantic. I remember Hurricane Andrew's devastation unleashed on South
Florida, and I watched the news along with everybody else as Hurricane Katrina
flooded New Orleans, claiming over a thousand lives. I know better than to be
reckless with a hurricane. They are not storms to be messed with.

And yet I
still love hurricanes. They are awe-inspiring, formidable, ferocious monsters,
the biggest and most powerful storms on the planet. There is something
exhilarating about standing on the beach leaning into the strongest wind you've
ever felt in your life, feeling the warm rain stinging your face, watching
bands of black clouds whip through the sky.

I think
hurricanes are a great metaphor for what God is like, and especially for what
it means to fear the God of grace. Hurricanes are dangerous and beautiful,
life-taking and life-giving, immense and furious---and yet deep inside the
spinning wind and waves lies a calm, safe center. The only way to truly be safe
in a hurricane is to stay in the very heart of the storm, the eye of the
hurricane. That center, the eye of the hurricane, is a perfect picture for what
it's like to live in relationship with the God of the universe. 

Look at
how Psalm 29 paints a picture of this hurricane-like God:

__

_The voice of Yahweh
is over the waters; the God of glory thunders. The voice of Yahweh is powerful;
the voice of Yahweh is full of majesty... The voice of Yahweh flashes forth flames
of fire. The voice of Yahweh shakes the wilderness... The voice of Yahweh makes
the oaks to shake and strips the forests bare, and in his temple all cry,
"Glory!"_

God is
like a hurricane, a ferocious storm of holiness and justice. He is the
Self-Existent I Am of Exodus 34, who flashes forth in glory and who will by no
means clear the guilty tramplers of that glory. He is, as Deuteronomy 4:24
states, and Hebrews 12:29 reaffirms, "a consuming fire, a jealous God." The
prophet Nahum paints a picture of the wrath of God breaking on this world like
a hurricane of fire:

__

_The mountains quake
before him; the hills melt; the earth heaves before him, the world and all who
dwell in it. Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the heat of
his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken into
pieces by him. Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows
those who take refuge in him. But with an overflowing flood he will make a
complete end of the adversaries. ~Nahum 1:5-8_

In that
vivid picture of our hurricane God, did you notice the strange insertion of
mercy and safety into the raging storm of justice and wrath? "Who can endure
the heat of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire!" Nahum declares. And
yet, right in the middle of the hurricane, there is the eye of the storm, a
place of safety: "Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; he knows
those who take refuge in him." 

Here's the
paradox yet again: the God of wrath who will by no means leave the guilty
unpunished is the God of unfailing, steadfast love and mercy, and the only way
to escape the wrath of God is to take shelter in the mercy of God. His mercy is
a stronghold of safety from his wrath. The only ones who can endure the heat of
his anger are those who flee to the eye of the storm and take refuge in him. God
is the only one who can save you from God.

We've
seen the solution to this paradox in the person of Jesus Christ. He is a
sanctuary to those who trust him and a stone of stumbling to those who don't.
He is the Lion of Judah and the Lamb of God, the One who absorbed wrath and
forgives sin. His cross is the eye of the storm, the center of the wrath of God
and the highest expression of the mercy of God. The place where the judgment of
God broke into history and was poured out completely is the only place to find safety
from that same judgment. In the violence of the cross we find safety; by his
wounds we are healed.

The Christian
life, then, is a life lived in the heart of the storm, in the place of safety
from which we can stand in awe of God's holiness and judgment and yet be safe
from their destructive effects. Standing in the calm eye of his mercy, we see
the wave of wrath break on Christ instead of us---a front row seat to the dangerous
spectacle of God. It's like watching an exciting, dangerous movie in the comfortable
safety of a theater, or experiencing the thrill of falling while strapped
safely into the roller coaster harness, or a little child taking the terrifying
leap off the diving board into the waiting arms of their father; as ransomed
Christ-followers we get to enjoy the danger of God while completely safe in the
faithful love of God.

Are you
enjoying the view? Or have you grown comfortable with our dangerous God? The
Christian life, lived in the eye of the storm at the foot of the cross, is
meant to be a continual drinking in of divine spectacle. Every day of the
Christian life is designed to be a day of seeing afresh with new eyes---every time
we open the Bible, every time we hear preaching, every time we worship, every
time we fellowship with believers---how our sin has been obliterated by the
hammer of God's wrath and how the tender mercy of God has shone on us with
undeserved kindness. 

At the
end of the day, this is what it means to fear God as a Christ-follower: to come
to the cross for shelter from wrath and then stay there for all our days,
marveling at the merciful and mighty God who has made us his forever. It means
striving to be holy as he is holy and living in obedience at the foot of the
cross in holy fear, knowing that we were ransomed undeservedly and at great
cost. And it means a life lived on mission, inviting and pleading for others to
come in from the storm before they are swept away forever. 

May all
our days at the foot of the cross be lived to prove the truth of promises like
this:

__

_Oh, how abundant is
your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you and worked for
those who take refuge in you! ~Psalm 31:19_
