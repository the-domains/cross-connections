What does the gospel have to do with the Christian life?

The cross is the center of history, the Bible, and the Christian life. In fact, the Bible explicitly ties every single thing that believers are called to do, think, believe, or say to what Jesus did for us on the cross.

"Walk in love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself for us." "Welcome one another as Christ welcomed you." "As Christ has forgiven you, so you also must forgive." These are "cross connections"- specific lines of motivation drawn from the cross to our lives.
