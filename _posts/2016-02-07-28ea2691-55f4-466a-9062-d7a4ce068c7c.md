**CHAPTER 2- THE WORLD**

****

**__**

**_You adulterous people! Do
you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore
whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
~James 4:4_**

In the sixth century BC,
the Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote his famous and influential book, "The Art of
War," describing methods of battle that have stood the test of time. Ever
since, it has been the favorite of politicians, kings, businessmen, and
soldiers. For a 2,500-year old book about battles, it has a surprising amount
of wisdom in it---wisdom that is applicable to the most important war in the
universe, the unfolding battle between God's kingdom and Satan's usurping
domain of darkness. This is a battle played out not with armies and generals,
but in the hearts of men and women either loving the light or embracing the
darkness. It's the battle in which you are engaged, whether you realize it or
not. And if you are a child of God, you have been conscripted out of this
world, "transferred from the domain of darkness into the kingdom of his beloved
Son (Colossians 1:13)," to advance God's kingdom in your heart and to the ends
of the earth.

Probably the most famous
quote from "The Art of War" is simple yet profound: "know thyself; know thy
enemy." Sun Tzu knew that if one was to have any success in battle, it would
start with a knowledge of yourself and a knowledge of your enemies. And yet in
modern times, how shallow is our understanding of our enemies! If we are to
participate in the battle as God would have us do, we must start by knowing our
enemies.

The first enemy that we
need to know is the world itself. In James 4:4, our enemy is defined in the
sharpest possible terms: "You adulterous people! Do you not know that
friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a
friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God." 

James' words are stern,
meaning to verbally shake us and get our attention. "You adulterous people!" he
says---or, literally in the Greek, "Adulteress!" "You're cheating on your
heavenly Husband," he says to his readers and to us.

That's what's at stake in
this discussion of worldliness. Ultimately, worldliness is not about
rules---"don't do this, don't say that, don't go there"---but about relationship.
Friendship with the world---that is, affirmation of and allegiance to the world's
way of thinking, feeling, and doing---is breaking the covenant of love between
you and your Savior. James calls it spiritual adultery, running away from your
heavenly Bridegroom who laid down his life for his bride. 1 John 2:15 puts it
simply: "Do not love the world o the things in the world. If anyone loves the
world, the love of the Father is not in him." Loving the world and loving God
are mutually exclusive; pick your side.

So what is "the world" that
we are commanded to not love? What does it mean to not love the world? What is
friendship with the world? If James and John are right, knowing the object of
those commands is one of the most urgent needs in the Christian life. A living
relationship of love with our Savior is what's at stake.

Here's a broad definition
of "the world" in Scripture: "the world" refers to fallen culture, values, and
systems of thought in which God is absent. And "worldliness" means to align
your thinking, feeling, and doing with that fallen culture, those values, and
those systems of thought.

There's a lot to unpack and
see in that little definition, but one clarification is necessary before we
dive into specifics. The Bible uses "the world" in two main ways. One follows
that definition I just gave: fallen culture, values, and systems of thought.
When the Bible is talking about "the world" in moral, behavioral terms, that's
what it means. But Scripture also uses "the world" to refer to the object of
Jesus' saving mission---as in, "For God so loved the world." Obviously, John 3:16
doesn't mean that God delights in fallen culture and and values and sends his
Son to save those things. John 3:16 is talking about 

_people_

. Therefore,
when the Bible talks about "the world" in reference to salvation, it's talking
about the scope of what Jesus accomplished at the cross: forgiveness, mercy,
and salvation purchased for people from every tribe and nation and language. It
the wonderful news that no one is excluded from the proclamation of the gospel;
if you a human living on planet earth, you are qualified for grace.

So don't get confused when
you see John 3:16 saying, "God so loved the world" and 1 John 2:15 saying,
"Don't love the world." One is talking about the breathtaking scope of God's
saving grace; the other is talking about the fallen culture, values, and
systems of thought that are opposed to God and in which God's people must not
take part. The latter is what this chapter is focused on. 

****

**GOD IS ABSENT**

I think the best way to get
a handle on how the Bible talks about worldliness is to go on a survey of a
dozen or so texts. The goal of getting all these texts on worldliness out
before us is to more fully understand all of God's warnings to us, so that we can
better know our enemy and resist all its temptations and deceptions. "Know thy
enemy," Suz Tzu warned us. That's the point where every victory begins, so
let's dive in to get a firm grasp on what God's Word teaches about this enemy.
Surveying the biblical landscape, one main truth emerges: worldliness is any
thing, person, thought, or activity in which God is absent.

FROM BELOW

__

_Jesus said to them, "You are from below; I am from above. You are
of this world; I am not of this world." ~John 8:23_

In John 8, Jesus is
debating with the Pharisees, and the basis of his criticism of them is this
astonishing claim: "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world;
I am not of this world." In other words, Jesus says, "Your entire argument and
identity has nothing to do with God; it arises out of your own earth-bound
agenda. My identity, on the other hand, originates with God himself."

The Pharisees' agenda,
their arguments, ways of thinking, and values had nothing to do with God.
That's what Jesus meant by, "You are from below... you are of this world." By
contrasting that with himself as being "from above... not of this world," Jesus
gives us an insight into the central nature of worldliness: worldliness is that
which does not originate in God. To be "of this world" is the opposite of
coming from God. That means that anything---even good things---that do not have God
as their central reference point are worldly.

The implications of this
are endless and nuanced. Think about it: in one sense, everything originates in
God. He is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe and everything in it. The
Pharisees that Jesus was talking to were created by God. The delicious pizza I
will enjoy this evening is, in the words of 1 Timothy 4, "created by God to be
received with thanksgiving." Everything in the world can, by virtue of its
creation by the Creator, have God as its central reference point.

But you and I both know
that, even though everything has been created by God, we go through most of
life and most of our interactions without him as that central reference point.
Though he is the North Star by which everything in our lives is meant to be
measured, we prefer to plot out our lives using the fickle compasses of our own
thoughts and desires. The Pharisees, though they were created by God to bring
him glory, "loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes
from God" (John 12:43). Thus they betrayed their created purpose and forsook
God as their originator and frame of reference. That's why Jesus said to them,
"You are from below... you are of this world." They had abandoned the Originator
and Creator, and no longer thought and acted with him at the center as the
North Star guiding their thoughts and actions.

In the same way, all those
good things that God created to be received with thanksgiving can all too
easily lose their proper frame of reference and become things that we enjoy and
desire apart from any thought of God. That pizza can become an object of
gluttony, instead of an object of thanksgiving and a springboard that leads to
worship. Instead of rejoicing over God's goodness to me expressed in melted
cheese and pepperoni, I will all too often "exchange the glory of the immortal
God for images" (Romans 1:23), the Creator for his creation. 

That's what worldliness is:
when God is no longer your central reference point and the originator of all
things, you will start to prefer the creation over the Creator. You can see,
then, the subtle danger all around us: everything and every person can either
lead us to worship or to worldliness. It takes a constant Holy Spirit-led
vigilance to guard my heart against its fleshly, rebellious tendency to make
idols out of things and people that were supposed to lead me to worship the
true King.

DEVOID OF THE SPIRIT

Note that this is the same
way that the little book of Jude describes worldliness:

__

_In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own
ungodly passions. It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of
the Spirit. ~Jude 1:18-19_

Do you see how this points
to the same reality that Jesus described in John 8? "The world" is any thing,
person, or activity in which God is absent. The Pharisees lacked God as their
frame of reference, and therefore Jesus called them "of this world." Jude draws
our attention to another group of people: scoffers---those who say in their
heart, "There is no God" (Psalm 14:1)---who are "devoid of the Spirit." Once
again, the heart of the matter is that God is absent. 

Note that what Psalm 14:1
says---"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no god.'"---doesn't necessarily look
like Richard Dawkins or other militant atheists. Psalm 14 describes this
scoffing as an attitude of the heart, a disregarding of God. That kind of heart-level
abandonment of God often works itself out as a casual, practical atheism of
behavior if not necessarily of speech. That's why these scoffers in Jude are
not described as rejecting the truth or reality of God; they are described as
"following their own ungodly passions." When a person lacks God as their
central reference point and highest Treasure, their heart will not remain a
worship-less vacuum; their own desires will become their de facto gods. Instead
of following God, they will follow their own passions. This is what Philippians
3:19 teaches: "Many walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their end is
destruction, 

_their god is their belly_

, and they glory in their shame, 

_with
minds set on earthly things._

" When you think of the phrase "enemies of the
cross of Christ," don't just think atheists. Think of those---perhaps
yourself---whose functional god is their own appetite, who do what they want
simply because they want to do it, without thought of God, whose minds are set
on earthly things. That's worldliness; that's what it means to be an enemy of
God.

It is these kind of people,
Jude says, who are "worldly people, devoid of the Spirit." Just like the
Pharisees in John 8, those who follow their own ungodly passions, whose minds
are set on earthly things, are "worldly people, 

_devoid_

of the Spirit."
God is absent from their thinking and feeling. That's worldliness: any thing,
person, or activity in which God is absent. That absence of God is the root of
every other fruit of worldliness; all those ungodly passions flow from a heart
devoid of the Spirit, a heart that lacks God as its central reference and
highest Treasure.

FOOLISH WISDOM

One of the main fruits that
the New Testament describes as flowing from this heart without God is systems
of thought and "worldly wisdom" that do not have God at its center. 1
Corinthians describes this thinking without God:

__

_Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in
the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God
through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. ~1 Corinthians
1:20-21_

__

_For the wisdom of the world is folly with God. For it is written,
"He catches the wise in their craftiness," and again, "The Lord knows the
thoughts of the wise, that they are futile." ~1 Corinthians 3:19-20_

Much could be said about
these two texts and the argument that Paul builds between them, but I want us
to see one key thing. "The wisdom of the world"---that is, the worldviews and
systems of thought native to each human culture---is futile and foolish for one
primary reason: "the world did not know God through wisdom." This is a worldly
wisdom that lacks any knowledge of God. That's why, no matter how powerful its
arguments or seemingly wise and astute and insightful it is, it will ultimately
prove futile and foolish.

Paul gives a specific
example of this worldly wisdom: lofty philosophical Greeks who rejected the
idea of a suffering Substitute who would save the world (1 Corinthians 1:23).
In their God-absent way of thinking, the cross was a nonsensical absurdity (1
Corinthians 1:18). And so it is today: our modern, Western, man-centered
worldview assumes that individual freedom and happiness is the highest possible
value, and everything else is secondary to my pursuit of happiness. In that way
of looking at the world, the idea that a holy God would crush his own Son under
the weight of sin so that his glory would be upheld and sinners could be justly
forgiven doesn't make any sense; it's unnecessary at best, and violent and
sadistic at worst. The cross is still foolishness today.

That's the result of a
worldly wisdom that does not have God at its center. Think of all the ways this
manifests itself in our culture today, all the ways of thinking that function
as basic assumptions about life. Postmodernism, a vague man-centered
spirituality, and scientific materialism combine to form the strange cultural
air we breath, influencing the way we think without us even realizing it.
Postmodernism says, "Whatever you believe is your truth, and it's true for you.
What I believe is true for me. Find whatever truth makes you happy, and believe
it." To get an idea of our culture's current in-vogue spirituality, listen to
Oprah or another one of society's media gatekeepers. It is fashionable and
popular to believe in a higher power that enables you to fulfill your potential
and live life to the fullest. Spiritual practices like prayer and meditation
are commended, as long as they help you to become a more fulfilled, balanced
person. And finally, our society's bent towards rational, scientific
materialism comes in and says, "All this morality and spirituality is fine, as
long as you keep it private and as long as it doesn't affect the rest of your
life. It's good to believe in something that makes you happy. But make your
real decisions based on things you can touch and feel and see."

EMPTY DECEIT

Colossians warns against
this worldly wisdom using different language to describe the same reality

: 

__

_See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty
deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental principles of
the world, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity
dwells bodily, and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and
authority. ~Colossians 2:8-10_

This worldly wisdom that
promises happiness and fulfillment actually takes you captive, Paul warns. From
age to age the specifics of the culture's philosophy might change, but it
always accords with "the elemental principles of the world" instead of
according with Christ. Note the contrast he draws between the "empty deceit" of
worldly wisdom and the fullness of biblical wisdom. Empty deceit is contrasted
with Christ, in whom the whole 

_fullness_

of deity dwells bodily, and then
Paul goes on to say that you, believer, have been 

_filled_

with that
fullness. The argument goes: why would you be taken in by empty ways of
thinking and living when the fullness of deity has condescended to come and
fill you? While Oprah and those like her promise "your best life now," God's
Word exposes our culture's pop spirituality as nothing more than empty deceit,
the same kind of futile wisdom that 1 Corinthians says is folly in the eyes of
God.

The reason that all this is
so important is that the way we think directly influences the way we live.
That's why the Bible's primary way to fight worldliness is not just with
behavior modification---"Do this, don't do that"---but with thought and desire
modification: changing what we think and believe and want. Everything you do
flows from what you believe about God and the world; if, down at the core of
your being, you really believe that your happiness is ultimate, then it doesn't
really matter what you 

_say _

you believe; your actions will ultimately
flow out of that heart- and mind-set.

That's why Paul's famous
command in Romans 12:2 is laid out the way it is: 

__

_"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the
renewing of your mind."_

Conformity to the world is
framed in explicitly mental terms. If the opposite of conformity to the world
is a renewed mind, then what does conformity to the world look like? It looks
like going along unquestioningly with the current cultural assumptions, never
stopping to hold them up to the clear light of God's revelation. It looks like
watching Oprah and never comparing her spirituality to the truth of God's Word.
It looks like watching tv shows and never questioning what values or worldviews
are being communicated. It looks like a life never held up to the mirror of the
Bible for critique. It looks like thinking apart from God.

ADULTEROUS DESIRES

As we continue to look at
the biblical texts describing worldliness, you'll notice a pattern in the
argument I've been building. We started by unpacking John 8 and Jude 1, with
the observation that worldliness is a life lived apart from God, a heart that
does not have God as its central reference point. Flowing out of a heart that
does not have God as its guiding North Star comes systems of thought apart from
God, hollow philosophies and empty deceit that promise fulfillment but don't
deliver. These God-less philosophies will inevitably lead to the third category
of worldliness: desires and cravings for worldly things. Instead of knowing and
treasuring God above all things, the emptiness of a heart and mind without God
create a vacuum that we try to fill with "stuff."

James 4:1-4 makes this
point clear. James connects a multitude of sins back to the worldliness at the
root: we have exchanged a love relationship with God for a passionate affair
with the things of the world.

__

_What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not
this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so
you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not
have, because you do not ask. You ask and you do not receive, because you ask
wrongly, to spend it on your passions. You adulterous people! Do you not know
that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to
be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God._

Do you see how the flesh
and the world team up here? James points out that our root issue is 

_desires_

;
that is, fleshly, sinful, selfish desires for

things. "You desire and
don't have... you covet and cannot obtain." What our sinful hearts want is 

_stuff_

,
stuff to pour into the God-shaped hole inside of us. But stuff can't fill that
gap and can't satisfy those desires, and so those unmet longings explode into
sin.

But then notice what James
calls all of this: friendship with the world. The natural bent of our flesh is
to love the world instead of loving God. With unsatisfied hearts we look around
at all the shiny trinkets in the store windows, the latest greatest electronic
gizmos, the newest fashions, opportunities to be popular or praised,
entertainment, things to make us comfortable, and we want them. We believe that
those worldly things will make us happy. And so we pursue them, spend our money
and time and attention on them, and look to them to give us joy and
satisfaction. 

James calls this spiritual
adultery, because in turning to those things for joy and satisfaction, we are
turning away from God, the fountain of living water, the only one who can truly
meet our longings. So often I think I can do both---that I can crave the latest
iPhone and still have a deep hunger for God; that I can sink my mind and heart
into hours of television every evening and still burn with passion for Jesus.
But just like Jesus, who said, "You cannot serve both God and money," James
expands on that and says, "You cannot love both God and the world." The heart
only has room for one treasure, just like my marriage vows only have room for
one spouse. And just like I can't cheat on my wife and still be a faithful
husband, I cannot look to the world's toys and treasures for satisfaction and
still be a faithful follower of Jesus. 

WEEDS OF WORLDLINESS

Listen to how Jesus
described worldliness in his parable of the sower in Mark 4:

__

_"They are those who hear
the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the
desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves
unfruitful." ~Mark 4:18-19_

We live in a culture of
weeds, perhaps more so than at any other time in human history. America is a
Disneyland of comfort, ease, and prosperity. Literally everything around us is
angling for us to bite the hook of "the cares of the world, the deceitfulness
of riches, and the desires for other things." All of American culture seems
designed to lull us into a contented spiritual sleep of apathy, coldness, and
unfruitfulness. This, of course, is Satan's strategy (our third enemy is hard
at work here, along with the flesh, to pull us away from God!); if he can't
swoop in and steal the word away from our hearts (Mark 4:15), he'll instead try
to get us to trade our seeds for his weeds. And like the story of Jack and the
beanstalk, we're enticed to trade away our inheritance for Satan's magic beans
of worldliness.

Jesus is saying the same
thing here that James is saying in his epistle. You can't flirt with the world
and be faithful to your heavenly Bridegroom, James says. You can't grow both
the fruit of godliness and the weeds of worldliness, Jesus says; one will
inevitably choke out the other.

IN LOVE WITH THE PRESENT
WORLD

There are many other texts
that illustrate the peril of flirting with the world, but none is quite as
chilling to me as 2 Timothy 4:10\. At the very end of his final letter, soon
before his execution, Paul is giving Timothy a sad update on the state of his ministry.
In verse 10, he mentions one of his fellow missionaries, Demas. Demas had
travelled with Paul on his previous missionary journeys. Years before, when
Paul wrote Colossians, Demas was one of the kingdom workers who sent greetings:
"Luke, the beloved physician, greets you, as does Demas" (Colossians 4:14). He
is listed among some of the greatest early church workers in Paul's letter to
Philemon: "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, send greetings to you,
and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers."

So needless to say, Demas
was a major leader and worker for the kingdom. He travelled with Paul for
years. He rubbed shoulders with giants of the faith. He preached the gospel and
probably led people to Christ. That's what makes 2 Timothy 4:10 all the sadder,
and sobering:

__

_Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone
to Thessalonica._

That's the epitaph at the
end of Demas' ministry: a deserter "in love with this present world." We're not
sure of the specifics---was it the lure of possessions, a job offer he couldn't
refuse, perhaps a woman in Thessalonica, or maybe just choosing the easy road
of comfort over the hard life of ministry? We don't know, but one thing is
clear: as enemies closed in around Paul and his ministry faltered, Demas
abandoned ship. When the going got tough, Demas got going, and left. Faced with
sacrifice for the sake of Christ, Demas' true colors came out; when pressed to
choose, he made his choice: he would rather have the world. He had spent his
life serving Jesus, but when push came to shove, he went with what he really
loved: the world.

You can see why this is so
sobering, especially for someone like me. My whole life is ministry, and like
Demas I have preached and taught and led people to Christ. I've travelled the
world for the cause of Christ. I have learned from and rubbed shoulders with
many incredibly godly people who have influenced me greatly.

__

_But so did Demas_

. And all his ministry, all his gospel work, all his learning and all
his mentors, were not enough to woo him from his real love. And the final
results were catastrophic; his friendship with the world proved him, in the
end, to be an enemy of God, and the weeds of worldliness choked out whatever
fruit could have blossomed in his life. And the end found him having abandoned
Paul, and with Paul, Paul's God and gospel.

Now don't get me wrong: I
believe in the assurance of salvation and the perseverance of all God's elect.
If Jesus has truly ransomed and indwelt your heart, he may permit backsliding
but has promised to make and keep you his forever (John 10:27-29, Romans
8:38-39). My confidence for myself is not that I will prove to be a better
Christian than Demas; my ultimate hope is that almighty God has made an
everlasting covenant with me, to never turn away from doing me good, and to put
the fear of him in my heart so that I will never fully turn away from him
(Jeremiah 32:40). But cultivating weeds of worldliness in your heart can, in
the end, prove that you never actually belonged to Christ (Hebrews 3:13-14).
Prolonged, unrepentant flirting with the world may betray that you never
actually knew the heavenly Bridegroom and, more devastatingly, that he never
knew you (Matthew 7:22-23). Demas' profession of faith proved false despite all
his work for Jesus, because at the end of the day his life proved what his lips
denied: that his true love wasn't Jesus, but the world. Oh, may God protect us
from the deceitful allurement of the world!

****

**WEED-WHACKING**

So evaluate your life: to
what extent have you allowed (or even encouraged) the weeds of worldliness to
take root in the garden of your heart? To what extent are your desires,
thoughts, and longings betraying a restless, adulterous heart that wants the world
more than God? Hebrews 3:12-13 gives us urgent warrant to examine our hearts,
with the help of fellow believers, and inquire to what extent worldliness has
crept into our lives: "Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an
evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God (like
Demas!). But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called 'today,'
that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."

Take those three phrases
that Jesus used and hold them up like a mirror to your life; "the cares of the
world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desire for other things." 

"The cares of the world;"
how much of your thought life is dominated by anxiety, fretfulness, or simply
absorption in activities in which God is absent? To what extent is God the
North Star, the central frame of reference, in how you think about all the
activities of your day? That doesn't mean you need to read your Bible and pray
eight hours a day. But what does God have to do with your grocery shopping?
With your trip to the gym? With your time at the office? Those don't have to be
godless hours; the reality and presence of God can permeate all those
activities and sanctify them if we will start doing the challenging work of
renewing our minds, pressing the truth of God's Word into the way we think, and
filling our spare moments with prayer. 

How about the next phrase,
"the deceitfulness of riches?" That's an eye-opening phrase if we'll choose to
really believe it. Nothing feels more secure than money in the bank, a good
job, a firm safety net. Life insurance, health insurance, car insurance, etc.
These aren't bad things. But the moment they become our trust, our confidence,
the reason we can sleep at night, they have moved from being good things to
replacing our heavenly Husband. They have displaced God from the center and no
longer operate in relation to him. And they will prove deceitful in the end;
money will never deliver on its promises of security and happiness. And yet we
keep trying and trying, thinking, "If I can just get that promotion, then I'll
be satisfied." But like a desert mirage, the target keeps shifting, and leaves
us thirsty and empty. Chasing fulfillment through riches is a surefire way to
waste your life.

So examine your motives.
What gives you confidence and security---a number on your bank statement, or the
rock-solid promises of God? Where's your identity---is it found in your job, or
in Jesus and what he has done for you? Why do you do what you do for a
living---to hoard resources for yourself and pad your lifestyle or to fund your
generosity and be a blessing to others?

Finally, "the desire for
other things." How's that for a devastating catch-all? Compare your desire for
Christ---to know him more, love him more, honor him more fully, share him more
enthusiastically---to your desire for other things. How does your desire for his
Word compare to your desire for television? How does your desire for others to
love Jesus compare to your desire for them to like you? The Psalmist said,
"Earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in
a dry and weary land where there is no water." Is that your experience? Or have
you grown content to slake your soul's thirst with the empty cisterns of this
world (Jeremiah 2:13)?

****

**GOOD NEWS FOR BAD PEOPLE**

That self-examination,
conducted prayerfully and with the help of believers who know you well, will
probably uncover weeds you didn't know were there, with roots growing deep in
your heart. What hope is there for people like us, people who (apart from God's
persevering mercy) would quickly prove to be just like Demas, to persevere in
growing holiness and not shipwreck our faith?

The good news for worldly
people like us is that "while we were still sinners, Christ died for us"
(Romans 5:8). He loved you at your worldly, adulterous worst. And now that he
has bought you with his blood, his assurance to you is that his cross does more
than just forgive you; it disarms the very enemies that would keep you from his
arms. This is the glorious gospel hope that we will unpack in chapter 5 and
then apply in chapter 9:

__

_Far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
~Galatians 6:14_

****

**CHAPTER 3- THE FLESH**

**__**

**_...your old self, which
belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires.
~Ephesians 4:22_**

Think of your three
enemies---the world, the flesh, and the devil. Which one are you most afraid of?
Which one keeps you up at night? 

Or perhaps we should start
at a different level: do any of those enemies worry you? Or are you comfortable
and naïve about the peril and danger of living peaceably with these enemies? 

So think about those
enemies---which one do you think is the worst? Is the danger of worldly
temptations what keeps you up at night? Or, like most of us, are you way too
comfortable with worldliness? How about Satan? Many of us think of him as a
little red guy with horns and a pitchfork---in other words, a bit ridiculous. Yet
we underestimate him to our own peril. When you consider that we have a
supernatural foe filled with ancient hatred and deception who is bent on our
destruction, the reality of Satan should be enough to keep us up at night.

But I'll tell you what I'm
most afraid of. Forget the world and Satan. Let them do their worst. What I'm
most afraid of---what really does keep me up at night---is 

_me_

. I'm most
afraid of myself. I have seen enough of my heart to know its deceptions, and I
truly believe that its deception is far more dangerous than "the deceitfulness
of riches" (Mark 4:19) or "the father of lies" (John 8:44). And while I know
that nothing can pull me out of the Father's hand to final destruction, I have
seen firsthand that I am more than capable of making shipwreck of my faith,
without any assistance from the world or the devil. I am my own worst enemy.

Do you really believe that?
Do you really believe that you are your own worst enemy? Or, put another way,
do you have a sober, biblical view of the flesh? The Bible's analysis of and
outlook on my sinful heart is so bleak that I know that without daily divine
intervention, I would destroy myself. I am daily fighting an insurrection
against God in my own heart; the rebels are within the castle walls.

To illustrate the deadly
nature of this enemy, consider the parable that we looked at in the previous
two chapters: Jesus' parable of the sower. Read his explanation of the parable,
and look for each of our three enemies:

__

_Hear then the parable of the sower: When anyone hears the word of
the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away
what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. As for
what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately
receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while,
and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately
he falls away. As for what was sown among the thorns, this is the one who hears
the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the
desire for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.
But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and
accept it and bear fruit._

Do you see all three
enemies? Satan is easy to spot; Jesus identifies him as "the evil one" who
comes and snatches away the word. And the world is there in "the cares of the
world and the deceitfulness of riches." But what about the flesh? Where is the
flesh in this parable?

It's easy to miss. The
answer is: it's all of them---the flesh is the soil! This is not a parable about
external dangers, although those dangers are certainly present in the form of
"the evil one," "tribulation" and "cares of the world." No, this is a parable
about different kinds of soil---different conditions of the heart. Each kind of
soil is a manifestation of the sinful flesh. The first kind of soil, the path,
is identified by Jesus as "the heart" that the word cannot penetrate. This is
the hard heart that refuses to embrace the things of God. Such a heart, Jesus
tells us, is Satan's playground---but the real danger is the condition of the
soil itself. The rocky ground is the heart that receives the word "yet has no
root in himself"---the gospel has not savingly taken hold. And so, while
tribulation and persecution threaten, they are not the true danger; the true
danger is the rocky soil itself, a heart that has not made full room for the
gospel. And consider the third soil; when you remember that in this parable,
the soil is the heart, you'll realize that the weeds are not external dangers
of worldliness---they are internal dangers of the heart. The weeds are the cares
and lies and desires of the heart that choke out the word and keep it from
bearing fruit in your life. That's especially clear when compared to the good
soil at the end of the parable: the person whose heart is "good soil" certainly
faced the same temptations as all the others. The difference between the good
soil and the others is not that this person never faced external opposition or
temptation to worldliness; the difference is the condition of the heart. The
most dangerous enemy in this parable is the soil, the heart. This is Jesus' way
of warning: you are your own worst enemy.

You see, the flesh is not
only a deceitful and deadly enemy in and of itself, but it is also the
battleground where the world and the devil wage war against us. In fact, it's
the only area in which they have any power. Think about that parable again:
Satan is powerless to pluck the word away from the "good soil," because it
immediately receives the word with saving faith. He can rage and threaten and
accuse, but a heart bearing fruit for God is savingly immune from him. The same
goes for worldliness; think back to last chapter and how much of the Bible's
description of worldliness centered around passions and desires. Yes, external
things in the world prompt those desires, but never forget that those desires
originate in a fleshly heart that prefers God to other things. Effective
warfare against worldliness is primarily directed at 

_me_

, at my own heart
and desires. The same goes for spiritual warfare; the best way to take your
stand against Satan's schemes is to guard your own heart and mind with the
truth of the gospel (see Ephesians 6:10-20). In both cases, the greatest danger
is 

_you_

---your own sinful heart that rebels against God.

We must grasp this
all-important truth if we are to make any headway in the battle against our
other two enemies. All our strategies against the world and Satan will fail if
we will not understand that the rebels are within the castle walls; my own
sinful heart is on the side of the enemy. Without a strategy that takes this
into account, my own Judas desires will betray me to the enemy's plots time and
time again.

Therefore, this is an enemy
that we must understand at all costs. So this chapter will focus on three
things that are paramount to know: the origins of the flesh, the deception of
the flesh, and the reality of the remaining flesh in the believer.

****

**THE ORIGINS OF THE FLESH**

If you have been a
Christian for a while and know your Bible, you probably know the simple answer
of where our sinful nature comes from (by the way, in this chapter, as in the
Bible, I will be using the terms "flesh," "sinful nature," "sinful heart," "old
self," and "indwelling sin" interchangeably; they all refer to the same
reality). You've heard that because Adam first disobeyed and rebelled against
God, we descendants of Adam have all inherited that sinful nature. And that's
true.

But what exactly does that
mean, and how does it work? Is the sinful nature like a genetic disease, passed
from parent to child? Could scientists announce tomorrow that they have found
the "sin gene," and start giving out shots to "cure" our sinful nature? Most of
what I've heard about the origins of the sinful nature sound sort of like
that---it's a disease, a poison, that infected Adam and spread to all of us.

And while that's partly
true (except for the part about scientists developing a sin vaccine), it
doesn't fully take into account the mystery of human nature that the Bible
holds forth. The Bible traces the sinful nature to one of the deepest, most
profound realities about humanity: God has constituted the human race as a
unified whole to be represented before him by one person.

That's a very unclear
statement, so let me unpack it a little further. When God created mankind, he
designated Adam to be our representative (or, in the words of theologians, our
"federal head"). What he did would count for all of us, in the same way that
your representative in Congress makes decisions and casts votes representing
you, the citizen. When your congressional representative votes, their vote
counts for their entire district; when my congressperson votes "yes" on a bill,
the entire first district of Maryland votes "yes." That's how our democracy
works.

This is similar to how God
has constituted the human race. We are, at the deepest and most fundamental
level of reality, not individuals. We are a unified whole, represented by the
one whom God appointed to be our representative. The decisions our
representative makes count for everyone he represents.

Now, please don't just take
my word for this---especially if this sounds esoteric and complicated. Please
continue to track with me, because it will turn out that this understanding of
human nature is at the very core of both the Bible's explanation of sin, and of
the gospel itself. This explanation of human nature is the hinge in the book of
Romans that transitions from Paul's unpacking of the gospel to his application
of the gospel. He takes ten verses in Romans 5 to elaborate on the parallel
origins of the sinful nature and the redeemed state of justification.

Paul's argument boils down
to this: in the same way that Adam represented the human race, and his sin is
credited to all who are united to him, so also Jesus represents a new human
race, and his righteousness is credited to all who are united to him.

Beginning in Romans 5:12,
Paul starts to build this argument, by pointing out a problem in the biblical
origins of sin that you may never have thought of:

__

_Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and
death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned---for sin
was indeed in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where
there is no law. Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose
sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one to
come._

Paul begins to say the
Bible story that we all learned in Sunday school---"sin came into the world
through one man (Adam), and death through sin, and death spread to all men
because all sinned"---and then suddenly stops short. He stops his train of
thought (a train of thought he won't pick up again until verse 18) because he
realizes that what he has just said is open to misunderstanding. It sounds like
what he means is, "Adam sinned and so Adam died, and so death spread like a
virus because everybody sins and now dies." It sounds just like the way we tend
to understand sin and sinful nature. But actually, he's trying to say something
that is almost the opposite of that, and so he cuts himself off and begins to
clarify.

He clarifies by pointing
out a discrepancy that, honestly, I had never thought of before. The problem
with simply saying that "death spread to all men because all sinned" is that,
if you think about the rest of human history in the book of Genesis, only Adam
actually 

_sinned_

. Only Adam disobeyed a direct order from God---"Don't eat
that fruit." Yes, Cain murdered his brother... but that was before God actually
said, "Thou shalt not kill." You see, the law hadn't been given yet---that didn't
happen until the book of Exodus. That's what Paul breaks his train of thought
to say: "sin was indeed in the world before the law was given, but sin is not
counted where there is no law." And yet it's clear when reading Genesis that
sin and death are rampant, even though no one is actually disobeying express
commands from God. That, of course, is what Paul says next: "yet death reigned
from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the
transgression of Adam"---in other words, death reigned even over those who didn't
transgress a command like Adam did.

See the problem? It makes
sense that Adam disobeyed God and therefore died... but what about all his
descendants? They didn't actually disobey God, and yet they died too. What's
going on? This is the discrepancy that Paul points out and makes the central
building block in his explanation of the gospel.

Paul argues that because
Adam represented everyone united to him (all humanity), his actions counted for
them. That's what he says about Adam through the rest of his argument: "Many
died through one man's trespass... the judgment following one trespass brought
condemnation... because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one
man... one trespass led to condemnation for all men... by one man's disobedience,
the many were made sinners" (verses 15-19). This is the unpacked version of
what Paul says succinctly in 1 Corinthians 15:22---"In Adam all die."

What this means is that
when Adam ate the fruit, God credited his action to you. In Adam, you ate the
fruit. Adam received the sentence of spiritual death, curse, and brokenness; in
Adam, that sentence applies to you. Death---both physical and spiritual---reigned
in power because of Adam, and because you are represented by Adam, spiritual
and physical death reigns in you too. The power of sin---its rebellion against
God, its distaste for truth, its blindness to the beauty of God, its powerful
attraction to worldly things---took root in Adam's heart, and because he's your
representative, it took root in your heart too.

The actions of one man
didn't just wreck the world; they wrecked your own heart too. Every sin and
lust and pride and envy that you struggle with in your heart, every insecurity
and fear, every bad thing that has ever happened to you, has its roots in this
reality: Adam was your representative, and he failed. That is the origin of the
sinful nature and all its horrific consequences.

Does that sound unfair to
you? Before you jump to dismissing Romans 5, or criticizing God for setting up
a rigged system, or deciding that everything bad must not be your fault (all
these are responses that your flesh wants to have), consider two things. First,
if this is how God set up humanity to function (and I think it's pretty clear
from Romans 5 that this is exactly his intention), then who are we, the
creature, to criticize the Creator? If the Bible is true, then this much we can
be sure of: God is infinitely wise and infinitely good, and he knows what he is
doing. We can trust that his plan for the universe is better than anything we
could ever come up with.

And there's a second thing
to consider, and this is what makes my heart sing for joy, even in this
discussion of the origins of the flesh. This argument that Paul is making in
Romans 5 is ultimately not actually about Adam and the sinful nature; this is
an argument about Jesus and grace. That's why, in verse 14, Paul inserts this
strange phrase: "Adam, who was a type of the one to come." In the Bible, a
"type" is a foreshadowing, a picture in history of a coming reality. Everything
that Adam did, which was then credited to us in all its power and consequence,
is a foreshadowing of the reality to come. And the reality is breathtakingly,
wonderfully beautiful. In the paragraph above, I pulled out of context
everything Paul said about Adam so that you could trace his argument about the
sinful nature. Now read it in context:

__

_If many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace
of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for
many. And the free gift is not like the result of one man's sin. For the
judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift
following many trespasses brought justification. For if, because of one man's
trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive
the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through
the one man Jesus Christ. Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for
all, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all. _

_**For
as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one
man's obedience the many will be made righteous.**_

That final sentence says it
all: in the same way that Adam's disobedience was credited to you---even though
you didn't do it---and you reaped both the eternal consequence of that sin and
its daily power in your life; so also Jesus' perfect obedience was credited to
you believer---

_even though you didn't do it!---_

and you now reap both the
eternal consequence of that obedience and its daily power in your life. That's
Paul's closing conclusion in verse 21: "As sin reigned in death, grace also
might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ
our Lord." For you believer, who are now united to a new and better
representative---Jesus Christ---sin's consequence has been decisively removed and
its power decisively broken, so that now righteousness's consequence can be
decisively yours, with the life of Jesus working in power in your heart.

This is the mystery of the
human nature and the mystery of the gospel: just as an act of disobedience
completely outside of you was credited to your account in all its damning,
destroying power, so also a life of perfect obedience completely outside of you
was credited to you in all its life-giving power. I think this is amazing: it's
impossible to unpack the biblical doctrine of the flesh and sinful nature
without running into the gospel! This is the wisdom and power of God on full
display---who else but God could have so constituted the human race that the very
thing that was our downfall---our union to our representative---could be turned
around to be the means of our rescue? As Paul exclaims in Romans 11, "Oh the
depths of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!"

****

**THE DECEPTION OF THE FLESH**

There is a particular
battle strategy that all three of our enemies---the word, the flesh, and the
devil---each share. That strategy is deception. If we will believe and embrace a
lie, we will then live out that deception, with all its damaging consequences.
We saw in the previous chapter that Jesus singled out "the deceitfulness of
riches" in his critique of worldliness. The world, and money in particular,
promise that which they have no power to actually give. Money promises security
and happiness and power, but all it can actually give is a mirage---a temporary buzz
and a false assurance---that only leads to destruction. And Satan, as we know, is
called "the father of lies" (John 8:44). He invented the very first lie in the
garden: "You shall not surely die." Ever since then, humanity has been
swallowing his lies of life apart from God.

What you may not realize is
that, while the world and Satan both lie, there is another liar much closer to
home. That liar is you. Your flesh---your own sinful heart---lies to you all the
time. And because this liar is so close, we are probably most susceptible to
believe it.

Jeremiah 17:9 gives this
sober diagnosis of the fallen human condition: 

__

_The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who
can understand it?_

And in case you don't like
that Old Testament diagnosis and want a second opinion, here's what Hebrews
3:12-13 says:

__

_Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil,
unbelieving heart leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one
another every day, as long as it is called "today," that none of you may be
hardened by the deceitfulness of sin._

Have you ever considered
that your heart lies to you? This, Jeremiah says, is not just a common
experience we all share; it is literally the defining characteristic of the
sinful nature. The heart is "deceitful above all things;" more than anything
else, your heart lies to you. Your thoughts and feelings and beliefs are not
morally neutral or objectively true; they filter through the sieve of the
sinful nature before emerging in your consciousness. Don't trust yourself, the
Bible urges. But because they come from our own heart and mind, we tend to
trust our thoughts and feelings even when we have objective evidence to the
contrary. 

That's why the Bible warns
against what every Disney movie tells us to do: follow your heart. The American
Dream---really, the dream of all fallen humanity---is summed up in that little
line, "Follow your heart." Pursue your desires, chase your dreams, do what is
right in your own eyes, and you will find success and happiness and your fairy
godmother will make all your dreams come true.

But what if your heart lies
to you? What if it is, in fact, a deadly and deceptive guide? Then instead of
finding success and happiness and fulfilled dreams, following your heart will
instead lead to ruin, despair, and death. That's exactly what the Bible says is
the consequence of following your heart. Even when the world makes our heart's
desires look so attractive, God assures us that "the end of these things is
death." The book of Numbers gives us an explicit, graphic warning: "Do not
follow after your own heart and eyes, which you are inclined to whore after"
(Numbers 15:39). Following your heart leads you into spiritual adultery with
the world and will end in your everlasting destruction. 

And it gets even worse. The
ironic and tragic thing is that this reality is really easy to see in others
and really hard to see in ourselves. Because the sinful nature is deceitful, we
are very easily fooled into thinking that our behaviors and motives are good
and above reproach, even as we can quickly spot the flaws in other people.
Maybe you're quick to get irritated by the know-it-all pride of that person in
the office, but blind to the truth that your eagerness to share Bible verses in
small group flows from a desire to be admired as wise, more than a desire to
help others and honor God. Maybe you shake your head at the hair-trigger temper
of a family member, but don't realize that the bitterness and grudges you hold
against that person are symptoms of the same sinful anger turned inward. These
subtle deceptions are really hard for us to spot on our own. Our lives are full
of sinful blind spots. 

That's why Hebrews says
that, in the face of this deceptive enemy, we must "exhort one another." We
need each other to look into our hearts and see what is obviously there yet
invisible to us. In the face of an enemy like the flesh, the Christian life is
impossible to live in isolation; the Christian life is a group project. We need
fellow believers to lovingly but firmly point out sin that we can't see: "I'm
not sure that your reaction to that person was justified or right." We need
people to question our motives---motives that usually seem so pure and upright to
us---and say, for example, "Have you considered that you may be acting out of a
desire to look good, rather than to serve others like you claim?" We need
brothers and sisters who will ask probing questions to help us get to the
bottom of our desires: "Why did those words bother you so much? Why do you get
so discouraged at relatively small setbacks? Why were you so angry at that
person yesterday?" Without the help of fellow believers, we will usually fool
ourselves into thinking we're progressing in sanctification, while all the
while an "evil, unbelieving heart" is growing just beneath the surface. Without
the input of those who can see what we can't, we are in great danger of
following our heart into destruction even when we think we're on the right
path.

You can see why I said that
this is the enemy I am most afraid of. There have been so many times that God
has graciously exposed the sin in my heart that I had no idea was there that
I'm amazed I haven't made shipwreck of my faith. I'm so thankful for God's
preserving grace expressed to me through my brothers and sisters who have not
been afraid to ask hard questions or give timely encouragement. Time and time
again, faithful accountability partners have applied the sword of the Spirit to
the roots of sin deep in my heart that I never could have uncovered without
help, bringing painful healing to areas of deception in my life to which I was
utterly blind.

DECEITFUL DESIRES

The Bible's diagnosis keeps
getting worse. Not only do our deceitful hearts blind us to our own indwelling
sin, but our hearts actively fight against our Christian life through desires
opposed to God. 1 Peter 2:11 urges us to "abstain from the passions of the
flesh, which wage war against your soul." Paul calls these "deceitful desires."
In Ephesians 4:22 he identifies them like this:

__

_...your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is
corrupt through deceitful desires..._

The main way that our
hearts deceive us and draw us into sinful behavior is through 

_desires_

.
We've already seen the reason that these desires are 

_deceitful_

; they
promise joy and fulfillment and happiness if only you will give into them, but
they never deliver. Instead, like a drug addiction giving ever-smaller returns
for ever-greater indulgence, these desires will slowly strangle our souls,
leaving us empty, bitter, and broken, and in the end, damned.

This means that the flesh
is something far more pervasive and powerful than just bad behavior. The flesh
operates not on the level of behavior, but of desire. Sinful nature is not the
fact that you looked at pornography; sinful nature is the assortment of desires
and longings deep within your soul that craved the brief emotional and physical
pleasure that pornography provides, the twisted selfishness that wants to use
other people to meet your own perceived needs, and the haughty disregard for
what God says about his purposes for sexuality. The act of looking at
pornography (or any other sinful behavior) is not the real issue, and victory
in the battle will not be found by simply addressing those behaviors; the roots
of those sins run far deeper and are far more difficult to discern and defend
against.

Because the sinful nature
is a constellation of rebellious desires rather than behaviors, the primary way
that the Bible equips believers to battle against the flesh is not behavior
modification, but rather 

_desire _

modification. What we need is not new
behaviors; we need new desires. These, of course, are far more difficult to
produce and control (impossible, in fact, apart from the Holy Spirit's work),
because what we desire is not just something we do; it's who we are. Sinful
desires flow from the very heart of who we are, and that's not something you
can just turn off with the flip of a switch. This points us to the central
reality of the Christian life: the necessity and reality of the Holy Spirit and
the new birth.

****

**REMAINING SIN IN BELIEVERS**

But this is where it gets
tricky. As Christians, we have been born again (John 3:3, 1 Peter 1:3). That
means that God has supernaturally placed his Spirit inside of us, recreating us
with a new heart and new spirit that is now sensitive and receptive to the
things of God. This is the great promise of the new covenant that Jesus bought
with his blood (Luke 22:20). Consider this promise from Ezekiel 36, which I've
put here in the New Living Translation because of how it captures these
glorious realities: 

__

_"Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship
idols. And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I
will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive
heart. And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and
be careful to obey my regulations." (Ezekiel 36:25-27)_

The hope that Jesus
purchased for us is that God would not leave us with our twisted desires and
spiritually dead heart, but that he himself would intervene, cleansing us from
our deep-seated idols from the inside out. He would perform spiritual heart
surgery, removing our stony, stubborn heart and giving us a tender, responsive
heart in its place. His Holy Spirit would take up residence inside of us,
prompting new desires to honor and treasure God.

But what does that look
like practically? Because of course you know that since you became a Christian,
you still have many of the same sinful desires rising up from within you just
like before you knew Jesus. Has the promise of Ezekiel 36 not come true? Did
God's open heart surgery fail? And if not, why are those sinful desires still
there?

The Bible's answer to that
question is multi-faceted and nuanced, but it's incredibly important that we
understand the full truth, so that we can combat the enemy's lies. Satan would
like nothing better than for us to get this question wrong---on one hand,
believing in a naïve triumphalism that doesn't appreciate the depths of
indwelling sin; or on the other hand a pessimistic fatalism that says, "This is
just the way I am" and fails to appropriate the massive, supernatural grace for
transformation available to believers. Both extremes are unbiblical and come
from not knowing what the Bible teaches about the sinful nature's reality and
role in the life of the believer.

THE WAR WITHIN

The truth is, our rescue
from the sinful nature, our spiritual heart transplant, comes in stages (just
like every other aspect of redemption). On the cross, Jesus not only bought
full and final forgiveness for every sinful desire and act, but also purchased
full and final victory over every last vestige of the flesh (Romans 6:5-6). But
that victory is applied to us in stages. At the moment of conversion, we are
born again into a living hope (1 Peter 1:3) and indwelt with the Holy Spirit who
serves as a living power for our gradual transformation now and the guarantee
of our complete transformation soon (Romans 8:9-13, Ephesians 1:13-14). The
condemning legal weight of sin, as well as its deceptive power to blind and
control, is decisively nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:13-14, Romans 6:6) so
that we can live free from its damning slavery. A new heart that beats with
tender responsiveness to God is brought to life in our souls, Satan's blinders
fall off our eyes (2 Corinthians 4:4-6), and we can see and respond to the
beauty and glory of Jesus Christ. We can truly say with Paul, "If anyone is in
Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has
come" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

However, that's not the
whole story. The stony, stubborn heart that Ezekiel promises will be removed is
still there. It's been disarmed and defeated, yes, but it remains. While Romans
6:6 is true---"Our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin
might be brought to nothing"---it's not quite dead yet. It's still there on the
cross, kicking and threatening and cajoling us to join us in its pursuit of
suicidal desires. And the tragedy is that we so often listen to it, continuing
to give into its crucified lies even while a new heart that loves truth beats
within us.

This means that the
Christian life is not the easy victory parade that we often expect when we are
first saved. Instead, the Christian life is a war---a war within, a battle
between the competing desires of our two natures. On the one hand, deep within
us is an implanted longing to be holy, to know more of God and delight more
deeply in his beauty and truth. And yet, right alongside those longings are
still selfish, stubborn desires---cravings for power and pleasure, to take what should
be mine and define truth and goodness for myself. Over and over again, in
decision after decision, the battle lines are drawn and fought out in the form
of temptation and conviction, sin and repentance, backsliding and growth.

Paul describes the frustrating
reality of this war in Galatians 5:16-17, and points us to the power that
enables victory:

_"But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the
desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and
the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each
other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do."_

The frustrating reality is
that in the battle of opposing desires, we often choose our flesh and are kept
from doing the things that our new, true heart wants. But the power for victory
is encapsulated in four little words: "walk by the Spirit." Choosing to side
with and cultivate the desires of the Spirit, and simultaneously begin to
starve the desires of the flesh, is the strategy of the entire Christian life
summed up in a sentence. That strategy of feeding godly desires and starving
ungodly ones will be unpacked in chapter 9\.

The good news in all of
this is that, while the remaining heart of stone within us seems so strong and
alluring, it has been decisively defeated. It really has been nailed to the
cross, and all its allurements are only the gasping lies of a defeated and
dying liar. And even more importantly, its ability to condemn us with the
weight of unforgiven sin has been fully removed. Though the war still rages, we
fight as rescued, forgiven people. The most important truth we could ever
internalize in this fight against the flesh is this: we fight against forgiven
sin. This news of freedom and power is what we will look at in more depth in
chapter 6\.

For now, we will end in the
midst of the tension. This is Paul's anguished, frustrated cry from Romans
7---and every believer in every age has added his voice to this complaint.

__

_"I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want,
but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with
the law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that
dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry
it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I
keep on doing."_

How often have you felt
like that? If you are honestly engaged in the struggle of sanctification, you
probably feel like that a lot. "I don't understand my own actions; my heart
betrays me, the enemies are within the castle walls, and over and over again
the evil I don't want is what I keep on doing."

What hope is there for
sinners like us---redeemed sinners to be sure, but sinners nonetheless? Well,
Paul has an answer for us. He doesn't leave us in despair, but quickly
catapults to exulting in the goodness of the gospel that liberates us from
slavery to sin:

__

_"Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of
death? _

_**Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!**_

" (Romans 7:24-25)

**CHAPTER 4- THE DEVIL**

**__**

**_He was a murderer from the
beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the
father of lies._**

When you think of the
devil, what comes to mind? A red guy with horns and a pitchfork who sits on
your shoulder and tempts you to make the wrong decisions? Maybe you think of
horror movies like 

___The Exorcist_

, or occult practices like ouija boards
and palm readers. These sorts of pop culture ideas can, without our even
realizing it, have a profound influence on the way we think about the demonic.

To what extent is your
understanding of the devil influenced by pop culture, or Scripture? God's Word
has things to say about Satan---warnings to communicate, promises to give,
warfare to equip us for---but if our understanding of him is fundamentally
flawed, our strategies for dealing with him probably will be too.

But even if your view of
Satan is biblical, if you're anything like me, you're also probably sort of
fuzzy in your thinking about him. Your understanding of Satan and the demonic
may be true but not very clear, simply because this is not a topic that is
frequently on your mind. But fuzzy thinking inevitably leads to fuzzy living;
if we will not do the hard work of searching Scripture and pressing on to fully
know God's revelation, the fruit of that will be shallow lives full of vague strategies
for vague holiness. God intends more for his people than vague, fuzzy lives.

**THE TWO-PRONGED DECEPTION
OF SATAN**

Sun Tzu, in the first
chapter of "The Art of War," wrote, "All warfare is based on deception."
Nowhere is that more true than in Satan's spiritual warfare. Jesus, in John 8,
gives us his scathing assessment on Satan's primary strategy: deception.

__

_He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the
truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own
character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. ~John 8:44_

Lest you think that
deception isn't deadly, see how Jesus links Satan's murderous heart with his
lies. "He was a murderer from the beginning," says the One who was there in the
beginning to see Satan's transformation from angel of light to murderer, "

_and
does not stand in the truth._

" The main way that Satan murders---that is,
destroys people and drags them down to the second death along with him---is
through 

_lies_

. From the very first lie---"You will not die"---that brought
down death on the human race, to his persistent whispering that sin is not
dangerous, repentance is not necessary, and Jesus is not who he says he is,
Satan kills more people through his lies than through his overt shows of force.

Satan, being the father of
lies, loves to hide behind his own lies to trick us about his purpose and
power. The thing we have to understand, though, is that Satan is clever and
uses different lies with different people and cultures. Satan's deception concerning
himself is two-fold; in some circumstances, he wants to trick us into thinking
he's not a big deal. In other circumstances, Satan's objective is the opposite;
to make us overly afraid of him. The former is the strategy he most often
employs in Western societies like ours, and the latter is his strategy in many
other parts of the world. 

In our materialistic,
scientific, "enlightened" culture, Satan has found it far more effective to
work behind the scenes. He doesn't need to ruin your life to damn you; in fact,
bringing suffering into your life might just wake you up from his slumbering
fog of worldliness. If he can lead you gently and blindly on a wide,
prosperous, gradually sloping road to hell, that's just fine with him.

But in many societies and
countries around the world, Satan works out in the open through demonic
oppression and fear. In places like that, the most effective lie he uses is,
"You have no hope of defeating me." People live in daily bondage to the
demonic, fearful of the spirits and their power.

When I was a little kid
(around 3-5 years old), my parents were missionaries in Thailand for a couple
years, and my family got to see this reality up close and personal. The vast
majority of Thai people practice a syncretism of Buddhism and animism---that is,
spirit worship. In Thailand, in the place where we would put mailboxes, most
people erect "spirit houses," miniature shrines where they can put offerings to
appease the spirits. These are often ornately decorated, but don't let their beauty
trick you; the compelling reason for their existence is fear. Whenever we would
move into a new house, my parents would always cover up the spirit house with a
sheet, making a statement that we would not participate in that spirit worship.
People were always horrified, saying things like, "Don't you realize that
you'll make the spirits 

_angry_

?

_"_

People in Thailand and
other places like it are in overt bondage to Satan, kept in chains of fear.
Don't dismiss their fear as the unenlightened superstitions of an ignorant
people; Satan is real, and he is powerful. My family got to experience that
firsthand in Thailand, as we stepped onto "enemy occupied territory." My
parents came in the name of the King of Kings who is triumphant over Satan, and
yet when you come onto his turf where he has authority, don't expect things to
go smoothly. Illness, discouragement, frustration, and fear hounded my family
throughout our time in Thailand, and eventually my dad got so sick---through a
series of medical mistakes so absurd that they can only be attributed to the
demonic---that we were forced to leave the mission field and come back to the
United States.

One particular story from
our time in Thailand which involves me illustrates the demonic oppression we
faced---and the power that our Savior wields over Satan's forces. One night, my
parents were jolted awake from sleep with the apprehension that something was
very wrong. They went down the hall to the room where my sister and I slept,
and discovered me choking and unable to breathe. Now, one thing you need to
know is that my mom is a nurse, a medical professional. And my dad has a
doctorate in computer science. They are educated, intelligent people. But in
this moment in the middle of the night when they discovered me choking, both of
my parents somehow immediately discerned that this emergency was not physical
in nature, but rather spiritual. And so my mom didn't administer CPR, and my
dad didn't call the hospital. They got down on their knees next to my bed,
where I was dying, and began to pray. And just like that, I began to breathe
again.

Spiritual warfare is real;
I am literally a living testament to that. Most people in the developing world
know this reality. And increasingly, Satan seems to be coming out from
"underground" in our culture as well, as eastern mysticism and "new age"
spirituality and the occult gain more widespread acceptance. More and more---and,
I fear, increasingly so in the future---Satan may be adopting a new and more
overt strategy of oppression in our society.

Yet just because we don't
daily experience spiritual warfare that looks like this doesn't mean it isn't
real, and doesn't even mean that it never happens in America. In fact, remember
how in the first chapter I told of a dear pentecostal co-worker of mine who
diagnosed my infant son's sickness as the oppression of the enemy? I told that
story as an example of the potential pitfalls of an over-inflated sense of
Satan's activity. And yet there is a little more to that story that I didn't
share. While my son's sickness turned out to just be the flu or some other bug
that was circulating that winter, a couple months before that, I had started
experiencing daily debilitating migraines. Most afternoons I would come down
with a migraine, and it progressed to the point that these headaches were
taking a real toll, not just on me physically, but on my family and ministry.
My doctor prescribed a medicine that didn't really have much effect, and none
of the other migraine strategies I tried were helpful. Several discouraging
months went by. One morning, I was coming down with a particularly early
migraine, and so I asked for prayer from the other teachers at my school.
Afterwards, that same teacher who just a couple weeks before had given me that
advice about my son, asked to pray for me, and proceeded to command the spirits
of infirmity and illness to stop oppressing me. To my surprise, the headache
lifted, and didn't return for a couple days. A few days later, when I felt
another headache coming on, I decided to pray in the same direction that my
co-worker had prayed, and commanded the evil spirit in Jesus' name to stop
oppressing me. The headache vanished again. That pattern went on for another
week or so---every time I felt a headache developing, I would pray against the
spirit of infirmity in the authority of Jesus, and every time, the headache
would disappear. After about a week of this, the headaches stopped altogether,
and have not returned.

Once again, I reiterate:
spiritual warfare is real. My experience with this reality has made me start to
wonder how much of our affliction, discouragement, and maladies have roots that
go deeper than the merely physical. Of course, please don't hear me
backtracking on what I said in chapter 1\. I think that the tendency to see
"demons under every doily" is a misunderstanding of both the Bible's teaching
on the demonic and of what it means to be physical creatures in a fallen,
physical world. Not every illness is caused by Satan. The common cold really
can just be the common cold. Many migraines are merely physical maladies.
Depression and mental illness can be caused by circumstance and chemical
imbalances in the brain.

And yet, that's not always
the case, and perhaps it would do some of us good---especially those of us who
tend to discount and ignore the demonic---to consider that perhaps Satan is more
active than we give him credit for. Some illnesses are spiritual (for example,
Luke 13:10-17 or 1 Corinthians 11:28-30). Some depression is rooted in
spiritual causes, or the direct effect of satanic oppression. Some of what we
call mental illness and try to treat as such are probably demonic
manifestations that we, with our "scientific" mindset, fail to discern. And
beyond the black and white categories of "physical" and "spiritual" is the
whole spectrum of gray that we, as fallen creatures comprised of both body and
spirit, inhabit on a daily basis. There are spiritual maladies that produce
secondary physical problems (one example would be my struggle with spiritual
depression, which in prolonged seasons of depression often leads to overeating
and weight gain with its associated medical consequences). And then there are
physical illnesses that Satan will grab hold of in order to afflict us with
spiritual consequences (for example, a cancer diagnosis that leads to
depression and discouragement). Truly, reality is complicated, and life is
messy. Navigating a broken world as redeemed sinners with broken bodies and
broken souls, participating in the cosmic battle against "the cosmic powers
over this present darkness" is a difficult, daily challenge that requires much
discernment.

In addition, in Ephesians 4
Paul gives us a window into the relationship between the demonic and our
struggle with sin:

__

_Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go
down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil. ~Ephesians 4:26-27_

Don't let the sun go down
on your anger---that is, do not persist in unforgiveness, bitterness, and
unresolved conflict---because doing so gives "opportunity to the devil." That
word translated "opportunity" is the Greek word 

_topos_

, which means "ground" or "place." It's where we get out word
"topography." What Paul is saying is that bitterness gives ground in our soul
to the enemy, a beachhead into which he can move and take control. 

Unrepentant sin is an open
door, a chink in the armor, which allows Satan to oppress us. Think about the
most entrenched, intractable sin struggles in your life, the pattern of
disobedience in which you've been struggling to repent and unable to change.
The temptations in this one area of your life---many believers experience this in
areas of lust and unforgiveness in particular---seem to ambush you when you least
expect it. You struggle with intrusive thoughts related to this sin. You even
have trouble praying about. Could it be that this area of sin has become a
beachhead for the enemy, a stronghold that can only be overcome by facing down
the reality of the demonic? The prescription of James 4:7 is the only strategy
that can successfully overcome strongholds like this: "Submit yourselves to
God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you." Submit to God, and then
resist the devil. Submit this area of your life to God's will and prescription;
bring it into the light, confess it to God and to fellow believers, repent,
appropriate the free mercy of the gospel that covers all your sin, and ask others
to hold you accountable. Only by first submitting to God and repenting will the
promise come true: "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." A heart
submitted to God gives no ground, no 

_topos_

,
to the enemy; when you are confessing and repenting and believing the gospel,
Satan has no choice but to flee.

So how do we tell the
difference between the physical and the spiritual, between the voice of our
flesh and the voice of the demonic? What patterns in my life may have given
opportunity to satanic oppression? How do we grow in discernment and a better,
more balanced understanding of the demonic? The answer is, go to the Book.
God's Word has clear answers, but we must be willing to do the hard work of
knowing and understanding the whole scope of God's revelation for this topic.
The truth about the demonic that we would like in neat bullet-point form is
scattered through the pages of divine revelation, told in story or mentioned in
passing, and it takes the discipline of study to be transformed by the renewing
of our minds.

**A BIBLICAL SURVEY OF SATAN**

So I think the best way to
get grounded in the tricky landscape of spiritual warfare is to do a quick
survey of what the Bible says about Satan and the demonic. You may actually be
surprised---especially if you come from a background where spiritual warfare is a
major topic---that the Bible honestly doesn't say a lot about Satan. (Although
maybe we shouldn't be surprised; this isn't Satan's book, after all, it's God's
book). There are many questions that Scripture leaves unanswered that I, in my
curiosity, would really like to know: what, exactly, led to Satan's fall? How
many demons are there? Where is Satan now? While the Bible gives us glimpses,
apparently God doesn't think that we need to know all the details in order to
live full, successful, free Christian lives. The central focus of the Bible is
not Satan and his power; it is Jesus and his almighty grace. And so we have to
be content to limit our understanding of the demonic to what the Bible 

_actually
says_

. When we do that, I believe that instead of having a crippled
understanding, we'll find that God has actually given us exactly what we need to
faithfully live for him in this fallen world.

THE ORIGINS OF SATAN

The Bible gives us a couple
glimpses into the origins of Satan, but doesn't answer all our questions. The
little book of Jude at the end of the New Testament says this:

__

_And the angels who did not stay within their own position of
authority, but left their position of authority, he has kept in eternal chains
under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day. ~Jude 1:6_

2 Peter 2:4 says almost the
exact same thing:

__

_God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell
and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment._

These are the only two
crystal clear texts we have as to the origins of the demonic, although
Revelation 12, Isaiah 14, and Ezekiel 28 may also fill in some details. Satan
was originally one of the angelic host, created by God. Based on the poetic
imagery of Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 which may describe this event, it is
possible that Satan wasn't just any angel but was in fact the greatest of the
angels, the most beautiful of God's creation. Apparently, at some point in the
distant past, Satan and those with him rebelled against God's rule and "did not
stay within their own position of authority."

At some point---this is a
great mystery that the Bible does not elaborate on---this angel, created in
perfect communion with a perfect God, chose to rebel. Why? How could pride and
the desire for self-rule have entered into the heart of a perfect being in the
presence of infinite beauty and goodness? We don't know. But Satan chose
self-determination, convinced others to participate in his rebellion, and was
cast out of heaven into hell with "chains of gloomy darkness," although because
he managed to usurp Adam's authority over creation, apparently he and his
minions now have some measure of freedom and authority on earth.

Genesis 3:1 and Revelation
12:9 tell us that it was Satan who deceived our first parents. Full of hate, he
determined that if he could not destroy God, he would destroy those made in
God's image, and so introduced the first lie into creation, and convinced the
first man and woman to join in his suicidal campaign of self-rule. That snake
in the garden, although not identified any further in the book of Genesis, is
named as none other than Satan himself in Revelation 12:9---"that ancient
serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world."
In successfully tempting Adam and Eve to join him, Satan brought the curse of
God and the ruination of all creation and enslavement to sin on Adam and all of
his descendants. Everything wrong in the world, all the brokenness you see when
you turn on the news, every heartache in your own life, all trace back to this
first cataclysmic deception when Satan convinced us to join arms with him
against the Creator.

THE ACTIVITY OF SATAN

Today, Satan continues his
campaign against God and against God's people, and throughout the Bible we are
given brief pictures of what this looks like. In 1 Peter 5:8 we are given this
warning about Satan's activity:

__

_Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls
around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour._

That picture of a hunting
lion is meant to say to us, "Take this enemy seriously!" Satan is not a joke or
a punchline. In the first two chapters of the book of Job, which we will
examine in more detail later, we are given a glimpse of Satan's power. While
under the authority of Almighty God---remember, he can't do anything against Job
without God's permission---nevertheless we see Satan wielding weather (1:16,19),
wicked people (1:15,17), and illness (2:7) in his quest to destroy. Satan is
dangerous, and we underestimate him to our own peril.

Passages like Revelation 13
and 1 Peter 5 tell us that the demonic influence of Satan stands behind the
evil and corrupt systems of power in the world. Events and atrocities like the
Holocaust and the ongoing persecution of Christians around the world are no
fluke or merely the outworking of the sinful nature. Rather, see in the news
and in your history books the activity of Satan himself. Peter makes this
explicit in his description of Satan as a roaring lion:

__

_Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion,
seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that _

the same kinds of suffering

_are being experienced by your
brotherhood throughout the world._

What, exactly, does it mean
for Satan to "roar" and "devour?" Peter identifies it: "the same kinds of
suffering" that your brothers and sisters are experiencing throughout the
world; in other words, persecution. From the days of the Roman empire, when
Christians were literally devoured by lions, to the beheadings of Christians by
Islamic militants today, to the rising tide of subtle ostracism and disapproval
facing Christ's followers in America, the raging hatred of Satan himself is
behind the persecution of believers. In the comfort of your safe, American
Christianity, violent persecution may seem far away, but consider this fact:
this year, more than 100,000 of your brothers and sisters around the world will
be martyred for their faith in Jesus. The roaring lion is still prowling around
today.

Continuing the biblical
survey of Satan's activity, when you read the gospel accounts of Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John, you see that Satan and his demonic agents have power to
possess, oppress, deceive, and cause illness and death. In Luke 13, Jesus sees
a crippled woman who had been oppressed by "a disabling spirit" and heals her
by casting out the demon. In Matthew 8 and elsewhere we see Jesus confronting
demon-possessed individuals and liberating them. We're told in Luke 22:31 that
Satan was behind Peter's denials on the night of Jesus' arrest, and in John
13:27 it is Satan himself who possesses a guilty, Christ-despising Judas in
order to carry out that heinous act of betrayal.

In addition (and perhaps
more dangerously), Satan is a master of temptation. In two places---Matthew 4:3
and 1 Thessalonians 3:5---he is simply called "the tempter." We're told in 2
Corinthians 11 that "Satan disguises himself as an angel of light" in order to
make evil look attractive and to tempt and deceive. The reason that this
activity of Satan is probably more dangerous than what he did to Job or to
Christians in the Colosseum is that it's way more subtle; why would Satan need
to use the natural elements and outright persecution to destroy us when he
could get us to destroy ourselves? Look at the world around you and at your own
struggle with sin, and it's obvious that Satan doesn't need natural disasters
or evil governments for his destructive work; temptations on computer screens
and street corners and in checking accounts will do just fine.

Our sinful hearts often
need no prompting to find the allurement of the world more attractive than
holiness, which makes Satan and his demonic cohort's job all the easier. That
connection between our sinful nature and Satan's ability to successfully tempt is
made explicitly in 1 Corinthians 7 in Paul's advice to married couples: "Do not
deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you
may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, 

_so that Satan
may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control._

" A lack of
self-control in your own heart gives Satan leverage to exploit and harm.

Finally, one of Satan's
most dangerous activities is also one of his most overlooked:

__

_In their case, the god of this world \[Satan\] has blinded the minds
of unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ. ~2 Corinthians 4:4_

Satan takes the native
darkness in the rebellious human heart and makes it pitch black, and blinds us
to the reality of God. He contributes to the hardness and blindness of every
person who hears the gospel message and rejects it. In our sinful state, we are
more than capable of rejecting Jesus on our own, but Satan does not leave it to
chance; his blinding power is added to our own love of the darkness to make it
impossible for us, on our own, to see and savingly respond to Jesus' offer of
grace in the gospel. If you've ever sat across the table from a friend or
family member and clearly, patiently, lovingly laid out the gospel and seen
only coldness and hardness in their eyes, you have been witness to the
devastating impact of this power. Only God's sovereign intervention in opening
the eyes of our hearts to see Jesus for who he really is can free us from this
power (2 Corinthians 4:6).

****

**A CASE STUDY: JOB**

Probably the most in-depth,
behind-the-scenes glimpse we get of Satan's activity in the entire Bible is in
the first two chapters of the book of Job. I've saved this story for last
because of its particular insight into how Satan operates, and what that means
for us today. Recall how the story opens: Job is a righteous, wealthy man who
delights in God and delights to do God's will. He consistently uses his
material blessings to bless others (see his description of his life in chapter
29 for a remarkable picture of what radical generosity looks like). He was
intensely committed to holiness, even offering daily sacrifices on behalf of
his children's unintentional sins.

But into this idyllic scene
enters the Enemy, beginning in verse 6:

__

_Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. The LORD said to
Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answered the LORD and said, "From
going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."_

We are given an exclusive
backstage pass to see the drama unfolding in the court of heaven. One day when
the angelic host (the phrase "sons of God" in the Old Testament often refers to
the angels) present themselves before God, Satan comes with them. This is one
of those places where, even with this backstage access, my curiosity is not
satisfied and I wish I could know more. Why are the angels assembling before
God? Do they do that every day? What is a day in the life of an angel like,
anyway? And who let Satan into the party? What is he doing here? I thought he
was kicked out of heaven; why is he allowed back in for this celestial event?
We're not given answers to any of those questions; I suppose I'll have to wait
until I get there to ask the angels in person. All we know is the information
given; Satan arrives in the heavenly court, and God begins a conversation with
him, and the conversation quickly turns to the subject of Job. God is quick to
point out Job to Satan, almost as if to needle Satan, saying, "Check out this
particularly great display of my character! Don't you just love that, Satan?"

__

_And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job,
that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who
fears God and turns away from evil?" Then Satan answered the LORD and said,
"Does Job fear God for no reason? Have you not put a hedge around him and his
house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his
hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But stretch out your
hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face." And the
LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him
do not stretch out your hand." So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD._

Satan is not nearly as
impressed with Job as God is. Satan is a cynic, so blinded by his own hatred of
God that he cannot comprehend the reality of a life transformed by grace and
glory. Remember that, because this is one of Satan's great weaknesses: as
clever as he is, he consistently underestimates the transforming impact of
God's glory on a sinner's soul (for another example of Satan's power being
undone by a sight of superior glory, read 2 Corinthians 4:3-6). And so Satan
cynically chalks up all of Job's obedience to the fact that he's been protected
and blessed by God. "Stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he
will curse you to your face," Satan claims.

What we see Satan doing
here is 

_accusing _

Job. In fact, that's what the name "Satan" actually
means; it means "accuser" or "adversary." Satan is the great accuser of
humanity, the prosecuting attorney, if you will, in the courtroom of heaven
(which probably explains what he's doing here in the story of Job). In
Revelation 12:10 he is called "the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them
day and night before our God." As we'll examine in chapter 7, that accusation
is Satan's primary activity as well as his most deadly weapon---and it's the very
weapon that God took out of his hands at the cross.

What's so surprising about
this scene in Job, however, is that God basically says to Satan, "Okay, we'll
see if you're right. You think he only obeys me because I protect him? Fine, I
remove all protection from him. Have at him." The entire rest of the book of
Job is the outworking of this wager; who will be proved right in the end---God,
or Satan?

There's something else
here, though, that is of supreme importance for us to see if we are to have a
proper, biblical understanding of Satan. In focusing an entire chapter on the
activity and character of Satan, it would be really easy for us to get an
overinflated view of Satan's authority and power. After all, in the next 7
verses of Job 1, Satan is going to literally unleash hell on poor Job and his
family, and we see Satan exercising control over weather (verses 16 and 19),
evil people (verses 15 and 17), and, later, illness (2:7). Satan wields
tremendous power over the created world. That's why it's so important to see
one crucial detail: 

_Satan is on a leash_

.

The Bible does not present
God and Satan as a yin/yang duality of equal and opposing power. God is the one
on the throne; Satan is the one on the leash. Before Satan was even able to
touch Job's family, he had to get permission. And God put strict bounds on that
permission: "All that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch
out your hand." Satan was permitted to go after Job's family and livelihood,
but couldn't lay a finger on the man himself. And when Satan's first assault
against Job failed to produce the desired results, he had to go back to God and
ask for more permission:

__

_And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job,
that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears
God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you
incited me against him to destroy him without reason." Then Satan answered the
LORD and said, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life. But
stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you
to your face." And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand; only
spare his life."_

Satan had to get permission
to afflict Job's body, and even then, God extended permission with limits; "He
is in your hand; only spare his life." Let this sink in, because what was true
of Satan's campaign of terror against Job is true of all his interactions with
you: Satan has to get permission for every move against God's people. 

And even beyond that truth,
the language that God and Satan use to describe Job's affliction is
interesting. In both conversations, Satan asks for 

_God_

to afflict Job
("Stretch out 

_your_

hand and touch all that he has... Stretch out 

_your _

hand
and touch his bone and his flesh"), and God responds by giving 

_Satan_

permission to afflict Job. What are we supposed to make of that?

Here's the lesson I think
we are supposed to learn: God is absolutely sovereign over all of Satan's
designs. Satan has to get permission before he moves, and even when he does
move, God remains the originator of the action. Satan may be the one doing it,
but God stands behind him with his own purposes. That's precisely the lesson
that Job himself drew from his pain; twice, he looked past the hand of Satan to
the hand of God holding the leash, and attributed his pain to God. And both
times, the inspired author says that Job is absolutely right:

__

_Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on
the ground and worshipped. And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb,
and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed
be the name of the LORD." In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.
~Job 1:20-22_

__

_Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity?
Curse God and die." But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women
would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?" In
all this Job did not sin with his lips. ~Job 2:9-10_

And finally, at the end of
the book, the inspired author adds this note in the epilogue: 

__

_Then came to him all his brothers and sisters... and they showed him
sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him.
~Job 42:11_

The consistent message of
the book of Job---and the rest of the Bible, for that matter---is that Satan is on
the leash and under the thumb of Almighty God, and can do nothing apart from
God's express will, purpose, and permission. And even when Satan does act, God
will not share any of the glory with him; he reserves for himself the glory of
being the ultimate originator of all events, even the ones that we see as bad.
When all is said and done in the book of Job, Satan doesn't even get credit for
destroying Job's life; even over that tragedy, God says, "I am sovereign, 

_I_

did that, and I will get the glory for it." 

What comfort this should
give to us, weak sheep threatened by the devil who prowls around like a roaring
lion! In the midst of temptation and trials, what a comfort it would be if we
could see our circumstances with the eyes of Job; to see that the roaring lion
is on a leash, and behind his growls is the smile of God our Shepherd and
Father, purposing all of Satan's evil intentions for our everlasting good.

The truth of 1 John 4:4
stands even truer for us than it was for Job: 

__

_Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he
who is in you is greater than he who is in the world._

The Almighty God who holds
Satan's leash has stooped to dwell in the hearts of us, his people, who have
been freed from Satan's most deadly weapon by the resounding victory that Jesus
wrought through the cross and empty tomb. In chapter 7, we will pick up this
theme and celebrate all its implications: Satan is not only a subordinate foe;
he is a defeated foe, and we can know for certain that Jesus' mission described
in 1 John 3:8 was successful:

_The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the
devil._
